## Install Objective (Must Complete)

Your job is not just to install a package. Your job is to leave the
user with a fully configured, running Signet setup.

You are done only when ALL of these are true:

1. `signet --version` succeeds
2. `signet status` shows the daemon is running
3. `curl -s http://localhost:3850/health` returns JSON with
   `"status":"healthy"`
4. The setup wizard completed with the user's selected harnesses and
   providers
5. You give the user a short handoff explaining what is now active

Default to interactive setup (`signet`) unless the user asks for
non-interactive flags. Never silently choose harness/provider settings.

## What is Signet?

Signet is the open standard for portable AI agent identity. It gives
you — the agent — persistent memory, a stable identity, a secrets
vault, and installable skills that travel with you across platforms.

The version of Signet you are installing is **not** a framework, SDK, 
or API wrapper. It is a background
system that runs alongside you, enriching every session with memory
and context automatically.

> This is good context to give your user. REITERATE THIS TO THEM AND 
WAIT FOR THEM TO CONFIRM BEFORE PROCEEDING. 

### Core components

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CLI** (`signet`) | Setup wizard, memory commands, daemon management |
| **Daemon** | Background HTTP service (port 3850) that handles memory, hooks, file watching |
| **Dashboard** | Web UI at `http://localhost:3850` for browsing memories, config, and status |
| **Connectors** | Platform-specific integrations installed during setup |

### Where data lives

All agent data lives at `~/.agents/`:

```
~/.agents/
  agent.yaml       # Configuration manifest
  AGENTS.md        # Operational instructions (you)
  SOUL.md          # Personality and tone
  IDENTITY.md      # Structured identity metadata
  USER.md          # User profile
  MEMORY.md        # Working memory summary (auto-generated)
  memory/
    memories.db    # SQLite database (source of truth)
  skills/          # Installed skills
  .secrets/        # Encrypted secret store
```

The SQLite database is the source of truth. Markdown files like
MEMORY.md are generated outputs from it, not the other way around.

### Supported platforms

Signet works with:

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI)
- **OpenClaw** / **Clawdbot** / **Moltbot** — these are the **same
  platform** under different names (renamed due to a lawsuit). Signet
  treats all three identically. Do not treat them as separate products.
- **OpenCode**

If the user mentions any of these names, they are referring to a
supported platform with a native Signet connector.

---

## How Signet Works (Read Before Installing)

Understanding what is automatic versus manual is critical. Most
install failures happen because agents try to do things that the
daemon already handles.

### What Signet does AUTOMATICALLY (do NOT do these yourself)

**Memory extraction from sessions:**
The daemon auto-extracts memories from your session transcripts using
an LLM pipeline. When a session ends, the transcript is processed and
important facts are stored in the database. You do NOT need to:
- Manually summarize conversations
- Chunk or split memory files
- Write to files in `~/.agents/memory/`
- Call remember after every exchange

**Context injection per prompt:**
When the user sends you a message, the daemon automatically searches
your memory database for relevant entries and injects them into your
context. Frequently-recalled memories are boosted in ranking
(rehearsal boost), and recent session topics are used to predict what
context you'll need next (anticipatory recall). You do NOT need to:
- Call `signet recall` before answering questions
- Manually query your memory database
- Pre-load context at the start of conversations

**File watching and sync:**
The daemon watches `~/.agents/` for changes. When files change:
- Changes are auto-committed to git (if enabled)
- `AGENTS.md` changes propagate to harness configs (`CLAUDE.md`,
  OpenCode AGENTS.md, etc.) within 2 seconds

**Session continuity scoring:**
After each session, the daemon scores how useful pre-loaded memories
were vs. how much you had to re-explain. This trend is tracked over
time and used to improve memory selection.

**Contradiction detection:**
When the memory pipeline encounters a potential contradiction (e.g.
"uses PostgreSQL" vs. "migrated to MongoDB"), it can flag the conflict
for review instead of silently overwriting. Semantic contradiction
detection is opt-in via config.

**Pre-installed skills:**
These skills are included and available immediately after install:
- `/remember` — save a memory
- `/recall` — search memories
- `/memory-debug` — diagnose memory issues
- `/onboarding` — interactive interview to set up your workspace
- `/signet` — learn about Signet's capabilities

You do NOT need to install these. They are built in.

Additional official skills are available in the Signet marketplace
(dashboard > Skills > Browse, filter by "Signet").

### What you SHOULD do manually

**Intentional memory saves:**
Use `signet remember "content"` when you discover something important
that should be pinned to long-term memory. Examples:
- User preferences and decisions
- Project conventions and rules
- Warnings and things to avoid
- Important relationships between concepts

This is for intentional, high-value facts. Do not call it for every
piece of information — session extraction handles the rest.

**Explicit memory search:**
Use `signet recall "query"` when you need to search across all
memories for something specific that auto-injection did not surface.
You can scope searches by time with `--since` and `--until` flags.
This is for targeted, deliberate queries — not routine use.

**Embedding health:**
If memory search feels degraded or returns poor results, audit your
embedding coverage with `signet embed audit`. If gaps are found, run
`signet embed backfill` to regenerate missing embeddings.

**Portable export:**
Use `signet export` to create a portable bundle of your entire agent
(identity, memories, entities, relations, skills). This is useful for
backups, migration to a new machine, or sharing agent state. Import
a bundle with `signet import <path>`.

**Secrets management:**
Signet includes an encrypted secrets vault at `~/.agents/.secrets/`.
This is how your user should store API keys, tokens, and credentials
— never in plaintext, never in environment variables, never hardcoded.

How it works:
- Secrets are encrypted at rest using a key derived from the system
- Secret names are listable, but secret values are never returned by
  `signet secret list`
- Secrets are never logged, never included in memory extraction,
  and never appear in session transcripts
- There is intentionally no `signet secret get` command
- To use secrets in commands, use injected execution via the daemon
  (`POST /api/secrets/exec`) or your harness secret-exec tool

```bash
signet secret put OPENAI_API_KEY     # Store (prompts for value interactively)
signet secret list                   # List stored secret names
signet secret has OPENAI_API_KEY     # Check if a secret exists
signet secret delete OLD_KEY         # Remove a secret
```

When your user needs to use an API key, have them store it with
`signet secret put`, then run commands through secret injection instead
of asking them to paste keys into chat.

---

## Safety and Scope

### NEVER use sudo

Signet does not require sudo for any command. Ever. If you encounter
EACCES permission errors during npm install, fix the npm prefix:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
```

Then add the PATH line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence.

If using bun, this issue does not apply — bun handles global installs
in user space by default.

### What Signet writes to disk

Signet only writes to these locations inside the home directory:

| Path | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| `~/.agents/` | Always | Config, database, secrets, skills |
| `~/.claude/` | Claude Code users | Hooks in settings.json, generated CLAUDE.md, skills symlink |
| `~/.config/opencode/` | OpenCode users | Plugin bundle (signet.mjs), generated AGENTS.md, skills symlink |
| `~/.openclaw/` or `~/.clawdbot/` or `~/.moltbot/` | OpenClaw users | Config patch only |

### What Signet NEVER does

- Requires or uses sudo
- Modifies system settings, OS preferences, or system files
- Writes anything outside the home directory
- Installs system services (launchd/systemd) automatically
- Sends data to external servers (everything is local)
- Deletes or overwrites existing files without the setup wizard
  confirming with the user first

---

## Installation

> GATE: Before proceeding, tell your user:
> "I'm going to install Signet, which will give me persistent memory,
> an identity system, and a secrets vault. The recommended installer uses
> Signet's native bundle and runs a small background daemon on port 3850. It only
> writes to directories inside your home folder — never system files,
> never with sudo. Ready to proceed?"
>
> WAIT for the user to confirm before continuing.

### Step 1: Check prerequisites

Check whether the native installer prerequisites are available:

```bash
curl --version
```

If you choose the Bun package-manager path instead, verify Bun first:

```bash
bun --version
```

If you choose the npm package-manager path, verify Node.js (>= 18):

```bash
node --version
```

If Node.js is missing and the user prefers npm, install Node.js LTS:
https://nodejs.org

Check the operating system:
- **macOS**: Fully supported
- **Linux**: Fully supported
- **Windows**: Supported via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) only

### Step 2: Install Signet

Using the native bundle installer (preferred on macOS and Linux):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Using bun:
```bash
bun add -g signetai
```

Using npm (alternative):
```bash
npm install -g signetai
```

These are the supported install methods. Do not use:
- `npx signet init` — does not exist
- `signet init` — does not exist
- `sudo npm install` — never use sudo
- Cloning the repository — that is for contributors, not users

> GATE: After the install command completes, verify it worked:
> ```bash
> signet --version
> ```
> If this fails, the install did not succeed. Check for errors above.
> Do NOT proceed to the setup wizard until this command works.
> Tell the user the installed version number.

### Step 3: Run the setup wizard

> GATE: Tell your user:
> "Signet is installed. Now I need to run the setup wizard.
> This will ask you to choose:
> - A name and description for your agent (me)
> - Which platforms to connect (Claude Code, OpenClaw, OpenCode)
> - An embedding provider for semantic memory search (Ollama is free
>   and local, OpenAI requires a key, or skip for keyword-only search)
> - Whether to enable git sync for your agent config
>
> The wizard will configure hooks, connectors, and skills automatically.
> I can run this interactively (you answer prompts) or non-interactively
> (I pass flags myself). Ready?"
>
> WAIT for the user to confirm before running the wizard.
> 

Interactive mode:
```bash
signet
```

Run `signet` with no arguments. It automatically detects a fresh
install and launches the interactive setup wizard.

Non-interactive mode (for agent-driven setup):
```bash
signet setup --non-interactive \
  --name "Your Agent Name" \
  --description "Personal AI assistant" \
  --harness claude-code \
  --embedding-provider <ollama|openai|none> \
  --extraction-provider <claude-code|ollama|none>
```

For non-interactive mode:
- Ask the user to choose both providers before running the command
- Do not default providers silently
- Use `--harness` multiple times or as comma-separated values
- Add `--embedding-provider ollama` and `--embedding-model nomic-embed-text`
  if Ollama is available
- Add `--openclaw-runtime-path plugin` for OpenClaw
- Add `--skip-git` if the user does not want git initialized

One-command install + setup for agents is allowed only with explicit
choices:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- --help

curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- -- \
  --name "Your Agent Name" \
  --harness claude-code \
  --deployment-type local \
  --embedding-provider native \
  --extraction-provider claude-code
```

If you do not have those choices, install first, ask the user, then run
`signet setup`.

The wizard will ask:
1. **Agent name and description** — the identity for your agent
2. **Platform selection** — which harnesses to configure (Claude Code,
   OpenClaw, OpenCode). Select all that apply.
3. **Embedding provider** — Ollama (local, recommended), OpenAI
   (requires API key), or none (keyword search only, still works)
4. **Memory extraction provider** — for auto-extracting memories from
   sessions
5. **Git sync** — optional, for syncing agent config across machines

Follow the prompts. The wizard handles connector installation,
hook setup, file generation, and skill deployment automatically.

### Step 4: Start the daemon

The setup wizard usually starts the daemon automatically. Verify first:

```bash
signet status
```

If daemon is stopped, start it:

```bash
signet daemon start
```

The daemon runs in the background on port 3850. It must be running
for memory, hooks, and context injection to work.

### Step 5: Verify the installation

```bash
signet status
```

Expected output should show:
- Version number
- Daemon: running (with PID)
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3850
- Path: ~/.agents/

Additional verification:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3850/health    # Should include "status":"healthy"
signet recall "test"                     # Should return without error
```

If `signet status` shows the daemon is not running, start it with
`signet daemon start` and check logs with `signet daemon logs`.

> GATE: After verification, tell your user:
> "Signet is installed and running. Here's what's now active:
> - **Memory:** I'll automatically accumulate memories across our
>   sessions. Important context is injected into every conversation
>   without you or me doing anything.
> - **Secrets:** You can store API keys securely with
>   `signet secret put KEY_NAME`. Secret values are not exposed via a
>   plain-text "get" command. When needed, I can use injected execution
>   (`/api/secrets/exec` or harness secret-exec tools) without asking
>   you to paste keys in chat.
> - **Skills:** Built-in skills like /onboarding, /signet, /remember and /recall are ready.
> - **Dashboard:** Visit http://localhost:3850 to browse my memories,
>   config, and status.
>
> From this point forward, I will begin to remember things across sessions.
> It can take a while for the memory pipeline and database to reach full 
> efficiency, but we will both experience this change happen over time.
>
> Want to personalize me? Say `/onboarding` and I'll walk you through
> setting up my personality, communication style, and your preferences."

## Migration from Existing Setup

If the agent already has identity files (from a Clawdbot workspace,
custom AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.), the setup wizard handles migration
automatically.

> GATE: If you detect that the user already has agent identity files
> (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, memory logs, etc.), tell them:
> "I can see you already have agent identity files set up. Signet's
> setup wizard will detect these and offer to migrate them into the
> unified `~/.agents/` directory. This preserves all your existing
> files — nothing gets deleted. The wizard will import your memory
> logs into a searchable database and connect your existing harness.
> Should I proceed with the setup wizard? It will show you exactly
> what it found before making any changes."
>
> WAIT for confirmation.

### What happens during migration

1. The wizard detects existing identity files in common locations
2. It shows what it found and presents a migration plan
3. With user confirmation, it:
   - Creates `~/.agents/` as the new home directory
   - Creates `agent.yaml` manifest pointing to existing files
   - Imports memory logs to SQLite for searchable memory
   - Syncs built-in skills and unifies skill sources
   - Installs connectors for detected platforms
   - Keeps all existing files unchanged

### Important migration notes

- **Do NOT manually copy files** to `~/.agents/` before running setup.
  The wizard handles this and knows how to preserve existing content.
- **Do NOT manually edit harness configs** (settings.json,
  openclaw.json, etc.) to point to `~/.agents/`. The connectors
  handle this.
- After migration, the harness workspace should be reconfigured to
  use `~/.agents/` as the workspace directory. The setup wizard does
  this automatically for supported platforms.
- If migration fails or you want to start fresh, you can re-run
  `signet setup` and choose "Start fresh" instead.

### OpenClaw-Specific Migration

OpenClaw (also known as Clawdbot and Moltbot — same platform, different
names) has its own built-in memory system. When Signet installs the
OpenClaw connector, it **must** disable OpenClaw's native memory to
prevent both systems running simultaneously. If both are active, you
get duplicate context injection and increased token burn — the opposite
of what Signet is supposed to fix.

**What `signet setup` does automatically:**

1. Discovers OpenClaw config files. The connector searches these
   locations in order:
   - `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` (if set, colon-separated)
   - `$OPENCLAW_HOME/openclaw.json`
   - `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
   - `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` (old name)
   - `~/.moltbot/moltbot.json` (oldest name)
   - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openclaw/openclaw.json`
   - `$XDG_STATE_HOME/openclaw/openclaw.json`
   - (same pattern for clawdbot/moltbot under XDG paths)

2. Patches the config to register Signet's memory plugin:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": {
       "slots": { "memory": "signet-memory-openclaw" },
       "entries": {
         "signet-memory-openclaw": {
           "enabled": true,
           "config": { "daemonUrl": "http://localhost:3850" }
         }
       }
     },
     "agents": {
       "defaults": {
         "workspace": "/home/user/.agents",
         "memorySearch": { "enabled": false }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Sets `memorySearch.enabled: false` — this is the critical line
   that disables OpenClaw's built-in memory search.

4. Sets the workspace to `~/.agents/` so OpenClaw reads identity
   files directly (no generated output file needed).

**Two runtime paths:**

- **Plugin path** (preferred): `signet-memory-openclaw` runs as a
  native OpenClaw plugin. Automatic memory injection on every prompt,
  automatic extraction on session end. Full tool suite registered.
- **Legacy path**: Hook-based. Uses `/remember`, `/recall`, `/context`
  slash commands. Manual — the user has to explicitly invoke commands.

The plugin path is preferred because it's fully automatic. The legacy
path exists for backward compatibility with older OpenClaw versions
that don't support the plugin API.

**If migration didn't work (both systems still active):**

OpenClaw ships frequent updates. If the connector's config patch
didn't land correctly (schema change, different config location, etc.),
both memory systems may be running simultaneously. Signs of this:

- Token burn didn't decrease after installing Signet
- Duplicate memory entries appearing
- Context feels bloated with redundant information

To diagnose and fix:
# 1. Find your OpenClaw config
find ~/.openclaw ~/.clawdbot ~/.moltbot \
  ~/.config/openclaw ~/.config/clawdbot ~/.config/moltbot \
  ~/.local/state/openclaw ~/.local/state/clawdbot ~/.local/state/moltbot \
  -name "*.json" -o -name "*.json5" 2>/dev/null
find ~/.openclaw ~/.clawdbot ~/.moltbot ~/.config/openclaw \
  -name "*.json" -o -name "*.json5" 2>/dev/null

# 2. Check if memorySearch is disabled (should be false)
cat <config_path> | grep -A1 memorySearch

# 3. Check if the plugin is registered
cat <config_path> | grep -A3 signet-memory-openclaw

# 4. If either check fails, re-run setup
signet setup --harness openclaw
```

If `signet setup` can't find the config, you may need to manually
patch `openclaw.json` with the JSON shown above. The critical fields
are `plugins.entries["signet-memory-openclaw"].enabled: true` and
`agents.defaults.memorySearch.enabled: false`.

---

## Platform-Specific Details

### Claude Code

The Claude Code connector installs:
- **Session hooks** in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
  - `SessionStart` — loads identity, instructions, and relevant memories
  - `UserPromptSubmit` — injects matching memories per prompt
  - `SessionEnd` — queues transcript for memory extraction
- **Generated CLAUDE.md** at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` from your
  `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`
- **Skills symlink** from `~/.agents/skills/` to `~/.claude/skills/`

### OpenClaw / Clawdbot / Moltbot

These are the SAME platform. The connector:
- **Patches config** in `~/.openclaw/`, `~/.clawdbot/`, or
  `~/.moltbot/` (whichever exists) to set workspace to `~/.agents/`
- **Installs hooks** for memory integration
- **Native adapter plugin** (`@signetai/adapter-openclaw`) available
  for direct plugin integration — this is plug and play
- Supports both legacy hook path and native plugin path

### OpenCode

The OpenCode connector:
- **Writes plugin bundle** to `~/.config/opencode/plugins/signet.mjs`
  (OpenCode auto-discovers plugins from this directory)
- **Generates AGENTS.md** at `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`
- **Skills symlink** from `~/.agents/skills/` to
  `~/.config/opencode/skills/`
- Automatically migrates from legacy `memory.mjs` format if present

## Common Mistakes

STOP. Read this section carefully. These are real errors that agents
make during installation. Do not repeat them.

| Mistake | Why it's wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| Running `sudo npm install -g signetai` | Signet never needs sudo. Fix npm permissions instead. |
| Running `signet init` | This command does not exist. Use `signet setup` (or `signet` to view the command map). |
| Running `npx signet init` | Not a thing. Install globally first, then run `signet`. |
| Assuming Node.js alone is enough | Bun is required to run the daemon (`signet daemon start`). |
| Manually writing to `~/.agents/memory/` | The daemon manages memory files. Do not write there directly. |
| Running `signet secret get NAME` | This command does not exist. Use `put/list/has/delete`, and use secret-exec to run commands with injected values. |
| Calling `signet recall` before every response | Context injection is automatic. Only use recall for explicit searches. |
| Defaulting embedding/extraction providers without asking | In non-interactive setup, ask the user which providers they want and pass both flags explicitly. |
| Building a custom HTTP integration | Use the setup wizard's connector selection. It handles everything. |
| Treating Clawdbot/Moltbot as separate from OpenClaw | They are the same platform. One connector handles all three. |
| Skipping setup or manually writing files | Setup configures connectors, hooks, skills, and identity. Use interactive or `--non-interactive`, but do not hand-roll files. |
| Manually editing `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks | The Claude Code connector manages these. Run setup to install them. |
| Cloning the git repository to install | Signet is installed via npm/bun as a global package, not by cloning. |

## Troubleshooting

**Daemon won't start:**
```bash
signet daemon logs           # Check for errors
lsof -i :3850               # Check if port is in use
signet daemon stop && signet daemon start  # Restart
```

**No memories appearing:**
```bash
signet status                # Verify daemon is running
signet recall "anything"     # Test search
signet embed audit           # Check embedding coverage
```
If the daemon is running but recall returns nothing, memories may not
have been extracted yet. The extraction pipeline runs asynchronously
after sessions end. If `embed audit` shows low coverage, run
`signet embed backfill` to regenerate missing embeddings.

**Skills not found:**
```bash
signet sync                  # Reinstall built-in templates and skills
```

**Embeddings not working:**
First, check embedding health:
```bash
signet embed audit           # Shows coverage stats
signet embed backfill        # Regenerate missing embeddings
```

Ollama is optional. Without it, Signet falls back to keyword search
(FTS5), which still works well. If you want vector search:
```bash
# Install Ollama (optional)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

**Permission errors:**
Never use sudo. Fix npm prefix (see Safety section above) or use bun.

**Need to initialize a workspace:**
`signet` with no arguments shows help. Run setup explicitly:
```bash
signet setup
```

## Scheduled Tasks

Signet supports scheduled agent prompts via the daemon. Tasks are
defined with cron expressions and executed by spawning Claude Code
or OpenCode CLI processes.

- Create tasks via the dashboard Tasks tab or `POST /api/tasks`
- Cron presets: every 15 min, hourly, daily 9am, weekly Mon 9am
- Run history with stdout/stderr capture available per task
- Maximum 3 concurrent task processes, 10-minute default timeout
