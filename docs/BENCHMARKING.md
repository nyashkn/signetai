# Benchmarking

Signet memory benchmarks run through `memorybench/`. The benchmark harness owns
the datasets, checkpointing, answer generation, judging, retrieval metrics, and
reports. Signet is only a MemoryBench provider.

`memorybench/` is a root workspace because it is a development harness, not a
Signet runtime package. Runtime code still belongs under `platform/`, human
surfaces under `surfaces/`, integrations under `integrations/`, and reusable
libraries under `libs/`.

## Current LongMemEval score

Signet's latest tracked MemoryBench LongMemEval runs average **97.6% answer
accuracy** under the `rules` profile. This is an average across the current
tracked local and canary score set, not a claim that every individual run lands
at exactly that value.

For the underlying run ledger and per-run accuracy, Hit@K, F1, MRR, NDCG,
latency, and context-size notes, see
[`docs/BENCHMARKING-PROGRESS.md`](./BENCHMARKING-PROGRESS.md).

## Default developer run

```bash
bun run bench
```

This command:

1. Builds the workspace with `bun run build`.
2. Creates a temporary isolated Signet workspace under `/tmp`.
3. Starts a Signet daemon bound to `127.0.0.1` on a free port.
4. Runs MemoryBench against LongMemEval using the `signet` provider.
5. Shuts the daemon down and removes the temporary workspace.

The default run uses a small LongMemEval sample, one question per question type,
so developers can run it while iterating. The command prints the exact
MemoryBench command and run id before executing.

MemoryBench reports scores by question type in `report.json`, so the default
run gives a clean per-type breakdown without extra commands. Benchmark reports
and run artifacts stay under ignored paths and should not be committed until the
team explicitly decides to publish a score.

## Larger runs

Run the full LongMemEval benchmark:

```bash
bun run bench -- --full
```

Run a fixed-size sample:

```bash
bun run bench -- --limit 20
bun run bench -- --sample 3
```

`--limit` and `--sample` select questions, not individual sessions. A small
LongMemEval question set can still ingest many sessions because each question
has its own haystack.

Run one LongMemEval question type:

```bash
bun run bench -- --type temporal-reasoning --limit 20
bun run bench -- --type knowledge-update --sample 5
```

Valid LongMemEval types include:

```text
single-session-user
single-session-assistant
single-session-preference
multi-session
temporal-reasoning
knowledge-update
```

Run an explicit question set:

```bash
bun run bench -- --question-id 32260d93 --question-id 54026fce
bun run bench:ingest -- --question-ids-file memorybench/config/autoresearch/longmemeval-canary-12.txt
```

`--question-id` is repeatable and also accepts comma-separated ids.
`--question-ids-file` reads one id per line and ignores blank lines and
`#` comments. Use this for fixed canaries so reruns test the same questions
instead of whatever a fresh random sample happens to draw.

Skip the workspace build when you already built locally:

```bash
bun run bench -- --no-build --limit 10
```

Keep the isolated workspace for inspection:

```bash
bun run bench -- --keep-workspace --limit 5
```

Preview the command without building, starting the daemon, or running the
benchmark:

```bash
bun run bench -- --dry-run
```

## Two-stage local model workflow

For local tuning, keep extraction cheap and reserve the stronger model for the
parts that affect reasoning quality:

1. Run ingest/indexing with a small fast model.
2. Continue the same checkpoint from search with the larger answer/judge model.

This avoids spending hours re-ingesting LongMemEval sessions through a 26B model
while still testing answer quality with the model we care about.

Example split run:

```bash
export RUN_ID="lme-rules-split-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
export WORKSPACE=".bench/workspaces/longmemeval-structured"
```

Start a fast OpenAI-compatible extraction server, for example Gemma E4B via
vLLM, then ingest. On a single-GPU workstation this can use the same port as
the later answer server because the phases run sequentially:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy \
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 \
MEMORYBENCH_EXTRACTION_MODEL=google/gemma-4-E4B-it \
MEMORYBENCH_EXTRACTION_MAX_TOKENS=1200 \
MEMORYBENCH_STRUCTURED_EXTRACTION_MAX_TOKENS=1800 \
SIGNET_BENCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama \
SIGNET_BENCH_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text \
SIGNET_BENCH_RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" \
bun run bench:ingest -- --no-build --workspace "$WORKSPACE" --limit 6 --concurrency-ingest 1
```

For impatient local iteration, ingestion can use OpenRouter while answer/judge
still use a local model later. Store the key in Signet as
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, inject it into the command environment as
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and pass `--ingest-openrouter`:

```bash
signet secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

```bash
SIGNET_BENCH_RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" \
MEMORYBENCH_SESSION_CONCURRENCY=4 \
bun run bench:ingest -- --ingest-openrouter --no-build --workspace "$WORKSPACE" --limit 6 --concurrency-ingest 2
```

`--ingest-openrouter` only affects `bench:ingest`. It maps the injected
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the MemoryBench extraction client,
sets `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, and defaults
`MEMORYBENCH_EXTRACTION_MODEL=inception/mercury-2`. It does not change local
answering or judging in a later `bench:evaluate` step. For local dev speed, use
modest question concurrency plus `MEMORYBENCH_SESSION_CONCURRENCY`; this only
changes how many sessions are ingested at once, not what data is written or how
answers are scored.

Then stop the extraction server, start the larger OpenAI-compatible answer/judge
server, for example Gemma 26B Q5 via llama.cpp, and continue the same run:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy \
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 \
SIGNET_BENCH_ANSWERING_MODEL=google_gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Q5_K_M.gguf \
SIGNET_BENCH_JUDGE=google_gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Q5_K_M.gguf \
SIGNET_BENCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama \
SIGNET_BENCH_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text \
SIGNET_BENCH_RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" \
bun run bench:evaluate -- --no-build --workspace "$WORKSPACE"
```

The `--resume` flag is a wrapper guardrail. It prevents `bun run bench` from
adding `--force` when continuing a checkpoint. Use it whenever the run already
has ingested data that should be preserved.

## Benchmark profiles

The wrapper supports two explicit Signet profiles:

```bash
bun run bench -- --profile rules
bun run bench -- --profile supermemory-parity
```

`rules` is the default. It uses the `signet` provider and follows the common
MemoryBench phase contract:

- ingest extracted structured memories through `/api/memory/remember`
- search with the orchestrator's requested limit, currently `10`
- answer from bounded recall results only
- use `/api/memory/recall` with `expand: true`, so any lossless source snippets
  come from the recall API surface itself, not a benchmark-side hidden context
  channel
- pass LongMemEval `question_date` into the Signet provider so relative
  temporal search phrases such as "four weeks ago" can be resolved into
  mechanical absolute-date search hints before recall
- do not dump full raw transcripts into the answer prompt

`supermemory-parity` uses the `signet-supermemory-parity` provider. It is not a
publishable fair-score profile. It intentionally mirrors the upstream
Supermemory adapter shape, which does **not** match the common provider shape
required for fair testing. Use it only to diagnose whether a low Signet score is
caused by Signet itself or by comparing against Supermemory's non-conforming,
more permissive adapter:

- ingest each session as the same date header plus stringified raw JSON
  conversation that the Supermemory adapter stores
- search with a limit of `30`, matching the Supermemory adapter's current
  hardcoded limit
- answer from raw session-shaped memory content instead of extracted memory
  summaries

Keep results from these profiles separate. A `supermemory-parity` result answers
"how does Signet perform when given Supermemory's adapter advantage?" A `rules`
result answers "how does Signet perform under the harness contract we intend to
publish?"

## Supermemory adapter contract violation

For a fair MemoryBench run, a provider should treat the orchestrator's
`SearchOptions` as the required test contract. The common search phase calls
every provider with:

```text
limit: 10
threshold: 0.3
```

The imported Supermemory provider currently violates that provider contract. It
does not honor the required `limit: 10` shape passed by the harness. Instead, it
hardcodes `limit: 30`, asks Supermemory to return both summaries and chunks, and
uses a provider-specific answer prompt that tells the model to prioritize those
chunks as raw source material.

This is not just a harmless implementation detail. It means the upstream
Supermemory provider is not being tested under the same required adapter shape
as strict providers. It can provide more retrieved items and richer raw session
context to the answer model than a conforming provider receives from the common
harness contract. This can especially affect incidental-fact questions, where a
raw chunk may still contain a fact that an extraction-based provider dropped.

For fair reporting, use the `rules` profile and document the exact provider
contract used. Treat `supermemory-parity` as a diagnostic profile only. It
exists to measure the advantage created by Supermemory's current non-conforming
adapter shape, not to produce a publishable score.

## Isolation rules

Benchmarks must never read from or write to `~/.agents/memory/memories.db`.
The wrapper sets `SIGNET_PATH` and `HOME` to temporary benchmark directories
before starting the daemon. This prevents production memory, Claude project
memory, and user identity files from being mounted into benchmark runs.

The MemoryBench Signet provider scopes every write and search with:

```text
agentId: memorybench
project: memorybench
scope: <question-id>-<data-source-run-id>
sourceType: memorybench-session
```

That scope is per question, matching MemoryBench's provider isolation model.

## Persistent tuning workspaces

Clean benchmark runs use a fresh temporary Signet database. For development
tuning, you can preserve and reuse a benchmark workspace explicitly:

```bash
SIGNET_BENCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama bun run bench -- --workspace .bench/workspaces/longmemeval-structured --sample 1
```

A persistent workspace keeps the Signet database under `.bench/`, which is
ignored by Git. Use this only for tuning and clearly label any results as
warmed or reused. Public/comparable benchmark numbers should still use a fresh
isolated workspace.

## Cached ingestion for local iteration

It is acceptable to do one expensive bulk ingestion into a temporary benchmark
workspace, then reuse that workspace while tuning retrieval, ranking, context
packing, answering, or judging. Treat this as a development fixture, not a
publishable benchmark score.

The safe pattern is:

```bash
export RUN_ID="lme-dev-cache-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
export WORKSPACE=".bench/workspaces/lme-dev-cache"

# One-time extraction + remember + indexing pass.
SIGNET_BENCH_RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" \
MEMORYBENCH_SESSION_CONCURRENCY=4 \
bun run bench:ingest -- --no-build --workspace "$WORKSPACE" --limit 60 --concurrency-ingest 2

# Repeatable search/answer/judge passes against the same isolated DB.
SIGNET_BENCH_RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" \
bun run bench:evaluate -- --no-build --workspace "$WORKSPACE"
```

Invalidate the cached workspace and ingest again whenever the thing being tuned
changes what gets written to Signet:

- extraction prompt or extraction model
- structured entity/aspect/hint schema
- `/api/memory/remember` request shape
- daemon graph persistence
- embedding provider, model, dimensions, or indexing behavior
- dataset selection or question sampling

Do not invalidate it for changes that only affect recall behavior after ingest,
such as search thresholds, traversal, reranking, context packing, answer model,
or judge model. That is the whole point of the cache: isolate ingest cost from
the parts we are actively tuning.

When reporting results from a cached workspace, say so plainly. The phrase we
use internally is "warmed dev workspace." A production/comparable score must use
a fresh isolated workspace and the intended production model configuration.

## Autoresearch ratchet workflow

The overnight random loop was useful for collecting failures, but it was not a
self-improving research loop. It repeatedly sampled new twelve-question runs
against the same code, so a good row could just mean the sample was easier. That
kind of loop is exploration only. It can feed a failure queue, but it is not a
scoreboard.

The local autoresearch workflow uses a fixed LongMemEval canary instead:

```text
memorybench/config/autoresearch/longmemeval-canary-12.txt
```

The canary mixes known failure targets with stable controls across
single-session preference, temporal reasoning, knowledge update, multi-session,
single-session assistant, and single-session user questions. Keep that file
stable unless we intentionally reset the scoreboard.

The ratchet rule is boring on purpose:

1. Pick one hypothesis.
2. Make the smallest code or prompt change that tests it.
3. Run the fixed canary against the same model split.
4. Keep the patch only if the canary improves without known regressions.
5. If a random exploration run finds a new skeleton, add it to the failure queue
   or propose a canary update separately.

Use the helper script for the mechanics:

```bash
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts status
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts ids
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts triage --run-id <run-id> --write-queue
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts compare --base <old-run-id> --candidate <new-run-id>
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts run-canary
```

`run-canary` prints the exact two-stage local commands by default. Add
`--execute` only when the local OpenAI-compatible model server is already
running. The default local split is Gemma 4 E4B for ingestion through vLLM,
Gemma 4 26B Q5 for answer/judge through llama.cpp, and Ollama
`nomic-embed-text` for embeddings. Answer and judge phases run with
concurrency `1` by default because the local llama.cpp 26B Q5 server is usually
started with one slot. It does not use OpenRouter.

```bash
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts run-canary --execute
```

If vLLM and llama.cpp cannot be resident at the same time, run the phases
separately:

```bash
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts run-canary --ingest-only --execute
# swap vLLM for llama.cpp
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts run-canary --skip-ingest --execute --run-id <same-run-id>
```

If they are on separate ports, pass `--ingest-base-url` and `--answer-base-url`.
If the answer server has more than one safe slot, pass `--answer-concurrency`
and `--evaluate-concurrency`; otherwise leave them at the default.

If a change only affects recall, ranking, context packing, answer prompting, or
judging, reuse the warmed canary workspace and skip ingestion:

```bash
bun scripts/autoresearch-memorybench.ts run-canary --skip-ingest --execute
```

If a change affects extraction, the structured remember request shape, graph
storage, embeddings, or indexing, invalidate the workspace and ingest again.
That is the line between honest fast iteration and fooling ourselves. No need
to laminate the pancake.

## Progress log

Development run history and score comparisons live in [`docs/BENCHMARKING-PROGRESS.md`](./BENCHMARKING-PROGRESS.md). Keep this file focused on how to run benchmarks and what the harness measures.

## What is being measured

The default `signet` provider uses the public Signet daemon HTTP API:

- ingest: `POST /api/memory/remember`
- search: `POST /api/memory/recall` with `expand: true`
- health: `GET /health`

The default `rules` profile is retained as a historical structured-ingest
baseline. During ingest it performs MemoryBench-side structured extraction
from each session, then calls the full remember endpoint with:

- extracted memory content
- structured entities
- structured aspects and attributes
- hint questions
- source metadata and per-question scope
- the lossless source transcript

The `dreaming` profile is the cutover-quality path: it saves only lossless raw
episodic sessions, waits until the full selected corpus is durable, then
triggers exactly one bounded daemon Dreaming pass before retrieval. Its agent
model is explicit (`SIGNET_BENCH_DREAMING_MODEL`) and travels through the same
daemon router as production. It is the profile used for absolute Dreaming
quality measurements; `rules` is not a substitute for it.

### Retrieval uplift ablation

`--graph off` disables both graph boost and graph traversal while leaving
episodic inputs and ordinary recall unchanged. For a controlled ablation, keep
one workspace and run id: first ingest, Dream, and retrieve with the graph on;
then restart from the `search` phase with the graph off. This preserves the
exact same episodic and semantic state for both retrieval surfaces.

```bash
export RUN_ID="dreaming-uplift-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
export WORKSPACE=".bench/workspaces/dreaming-uplift"

# Capture the graph-on report before reusing the run checkpoint.
SIGNET_BENCH_RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" \
bun scripts/bench-memory.ts --profile dreaming --graph on --workspace "$WORKSPACE" --full
cp "memorybench/data/runs/$RUN_ID/report.json" "memorybench/data/runs/$RUN_ID/report-graph-on.json"

# Re-run only search → answer → evaluate → report against the unchanged DB.
SIGNET_BENCH_RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" \
bun scripts/bench-memory.ts --profile dreaming --graph off --workspace "$WORKSPACE" --resume -r "$RUN_ID" -f search
cp "memorybench/data/runs/$RUN_ID/report.json" "memorybench/data/runs/$RUN_ID/report-graph-off.json"
```

Compare LongMemEval retrieval aggregates (`hit@k`, recall, MRR, NDCG), not
answer-model scores alone.

The isolated daemon does not run legacy extraction or structural workers for
benchmark ingestion. Graph and traversal are enabled only so recall can use
the semantic state created by the selected profile. In the baseline that state
comes from the explicit structured payload; in `dreaming`, it comes only from
the post-ingest Dreaming pass. Recall treats active structured rows as a
first-class candidate source by searching entity names,
aspects, group keys, claim keys, attribute kinds, and attribute content before
SEC reranking. This is deliberately generic: bridges may connect broad query
classes like music, service, brand, or currentness to nearby vocabulary, but the
daemon must not contain LongMemEval answer names or dataset-specific product
terms. Prospective hint recall stays enabled because those hints are part of the
structured remember payload, not a background extraction shortcut. Recall may
attach a bounded transcript excerpt to a retrieved memory, or add a
low-confidence transcript-only supplemental hit, when `expand: true` is
requested. Those snippets are returned by the recall API and capped so they
cannot outrank real memory evidence; the benchmark harness does not append raw
transcripts on its own.

The isolated daemon also disables structural backfill/classification. No daemon
repair job may infer benchmark graph state after the fact.

## Structured remembering contract

Structured remembering is not "proper noun extraction." Proper nouns are an
easy case, but the graph contract is broader and simpler:

- entity: a durable referent that can be expanded
- aspect: a stable facet of that entity
- group key: a navigable subgroup inside an aspect
- claim key: the specific updateable claim slot within a group
- attribute: a sourced claim value attached to that claim slot

For benchmark memories, generic personal facts should not be dropped just
because they are not named products or places. They should be attached to a
scoped subject entity. For example:

```text
Entity: MemoryBench User <question-scope>
Aspect: music preferences
Attribute: has been listening to Arctic Monkeys and The Neighbourhood on Spotify lately

Aspect: commute routine
Attribute: commute to work takes about 30 minutes

Aspect: morning routine
Attribute: getting ready takes about one hour

Aspect: dining history
Group key: restaurants
Claim key: korean_restaurants_tried_count
Attribute: tried three Korean restaurants recently on 2023-08-11
Attribute: tried four Korean restaurants so far on 2023-09-30
```

The remember endpoint accepts structured data directly. If an aspect references
an entity that was not present in the relation list, the daemon creates that
entity and attaches the aspect/attributes in the same transaction. This lets the
client be explicit about what is being saved and why, without relying on the
background pipeline to invent graph structure.

Temporal and update-sensitive attributes should preserve words like
`currently`, `recently`, `previously`, counts, dates, and before/after
relationships. The storage schema has active/superseded status fields, so
structured benchmark ingestion sends each session source timestamp into the
remember endpoint. Supersession requires the same scoped entity, the same
aspect, the same group key, and the same claim key. Attributes without a claim
key are saved as ordinary evidence and do not automatically supersede sibling
attributes. When a newer structured attribute conflicts with an older attribute
on the same grouped claim key, the daemon marks the older attribute as
superseded and records the replacement attribute id. Recall then dampens
memories whose structured facts are only stale and annotates returned context
with a `[Signet currentness]` note so the answer model can prefer the current
replacement instead of guessing from two conflicting memories.

MemoryBench still performs the answer and judge phases itself. This keeps the
benchmark comparable with the other providers and avoids benchmark-specific
changes to MemoryBench scoring logic.

## Reports

MemoryBench writes checkpoints and reports under `memorybench/data/runs/`.
That directory is ignored by Git. Reports should be attached to PRs or release
notes only when benchmark numbers are being used to justify a memory-system
change.
