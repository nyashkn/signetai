# Hooks System

Signet's hook system lets [[harnesses]] integrate with session lifecycle events — injecting [[memory]] at session start, capturing summaries at compaction, and triggering MEMORY.md synthesis.

---

## Overview

Hooks are HTTP endpoints exposed by the Signet [[daemon]]. Harnesses call them at specific lifecycle points:

| Hook | When | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `session-start` | New session begins | Inject memories, identity, and the Memory Check Loop into context |
| `user-prompt-submit` | Before each user turn | Inject compact current-view context only when the prompt mentions a known entity or active entity alias |
| `session-end` | Session finishes | Persist transcript lineage and queue session summary |
| `pre-compaction` | Before context compaction | Get summary guidelines |
| `compaction-complete` | After compaction | Save a first-class compaction artifact into the temporal DAG |
| `synthesis` | Scheduled or manual | Get prompt to regenerate MEMORY.md |
| `synthesis/complete` | After synthesis | Save the merge-safe temporal head |

---

## Per-Session Bypass

Bypass silences all Signet hooks for a single session without stopping the
daemon. This is useful when you want to work without automatic memory
extraction but still have access to MCP tools like `memory_search` and
`memory_store`.

### Activation paths

1. **Environment variable** — Set `SIGNET_BYPASS=1` before starting a session.
   The CLI hook process exits immediately with code 0; the daemon is never
   contacted.

2. **Daemon API / MCP tool / Dashboard** — The session is tracked normally,
   but the bypass flag is flipped. All hook endpoints return empty no-op
   responses with `bypassed: true` in the response body.

### Behavior when bypassed

When bypass is active for a session, all seven hook endpoints return empty
no-op responses with `bypassed: true`:

- `session-start` — no memories or identity injected
- `user-prompt-submit` — no per-prompt context loaded
- `session-end` — no memory extraction (but the session claim is still
  released so future sessions are not blocked)
- `pre-compaction` — no summary guidelines
- `compaction-complete` — summary is discarded
- `remember` — memory is not saved
- `recall` — no search results returned

The `synthesis` and `synthesis/complete` hooks are **not** affected by bypass.
They are scheduler-driven and have no session context.

The `SIGNET_BYPASS=1` environment variable causes the CLI hook process to
exit immediately — the daemon is never contacted, so no session is created
and no network request is made.

---

## Session Start Hook

**`POST /api/hooks/session-start`**

Called when a new agent session begins. Returns memories and context formatted for injection into the system prompt.

### Request

```json
{
  "harness": "openclaw",
  "agentId": "optional-agent-id",
  "harnessAgentId": "optional-harness-native-subagent-id",
  "parentSessionKey": "optional-parent-session-key",
  "context": "optional context string",
  "sessionKey": "optional-session-identifier"
}
```

`harness` is required. Everything else is optional. `agentId` is the Signet
persistence scope. Harness-native sub-agent identifiers should be sent as
`harnessAgentId`; they are used only for parent-session inference.

### Response

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "name": "Mr. Claude",
    "description": "Personal AI assistant"
  },
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "content": "nicholai prefers bun over npm",
      "type": "preference",
      "importance": 0.8,
      "created_at": "2025-02-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "recentContext": "<!-- MEMORY.md contents -->",
  "inject": "You are Mr. Claude...\n\n## Relevant Memories\n- ..."
}
```

The `inject` field is ready-to-use text for prepending to the system prompt. It includes identity, memories, recent context, and the Memory Check Loop formatted as markdown.

The Memory Check Loop tells agents when prior context may matter, how to run
1-3 targeted recalls, what pitfalls to avoid, and how to verify they are
grounded before acting. It is intentionally behavioral prompt shaping, not a
new hook schema or recall algorithm.

### Configuration

In `agent.yaml` (see [[configuration]]):

```yaml
hooks:
  sessionStart:
    recallLimit: 10            # How many memories to include
    includeIdentity: true      # Include identity files
    includeRecentContext: true # Include MEMORY.md content
    recencyBias: 0.7           # 0=importance-only, 1=recency-only

  contextProfiles:
    coding:
      sessionStart:
        recallLimit: 5
        maxInjectTokens: 5000
      identity:
        files:
          - path: context-profiles/coding/AGENTS.md
            maxChars: 2200
    rich:
      sessionStart:
        recallLimit: 50
        maxInjectTokens: 20000
  harnessProfiles:
    pi: coding
    hermes-agent: rich
```

Context profiles override hook budgets and startup identity/context files
per harness. Use them to keep coding harnesses lean while preserving richer
cold-start identity in operator or character-forward harnesses. For a compact
coding prompt, run `signet context compile --profile coding --max-chars 2200`;
that ACPX/inference-backed compiler reads the canonical identity files and
writes `context-profiles/coding/AGENTS.md`. Session-start hooks only read the
compiled artifact, so model synthesis is never performed in the hot hook path.

Memory scoring uses: `score = importance × (1 - recencyBias) + recency × recencyBias`

where recency is `1 / (1 + age_in_days)`.

---

## User Prompt Submit Hook

**`POST /api/hooks/user-prompt-submit`**

Called before each user turn is handed to the model. Prompt-submit does not run
generic memory recall and does not inject fallback guidance when it cannot find
a confident match.

The hook listens for known ontology entities and active entity aliases. When a
prompt names one, the entity match scopes the search, then Signet scores that
entity's current attributes against the remaining prompt. The highest-scoring
attributes choose which aspects to inject into a compact
`## Relevant Entity Context` block. `hooks.userPromptSubmit.minScore` gates
attribute-driven aspect selection; `maxInjectChars` caps the block.

When the prompt is low-signal, mentions no known entity or alias, is ambiguous,
or no attribute clears the confidence gate, the hook returns an empty `inject`
string. Literal aspect names alone do not select context. This keeps the active
agent loop trustable: absence of injected context means Signet chose not to
inject, not that the broader source substrate has no relevant evidence.

Explicit recall remains available through `/api/memory/recall`, `signet_recall`,
`memory_search`, and related MCP/CLI surfaces. Raw transcript search is
deliberately not injected through this hook; use `session_search` when a caller
needs transcript evidence.

---

## Pre-Compaction Hook

**`POST /api/hooks/pre-compaction`**

Called before the harness compresses/summarizes the conversation context. Returns a prompt and guidelines for generating a durable session summary.

### Request

```json
{
  "harness": "openclaw",
  "sessionContext": "optional current session summary",
  "messageCount": 150,
  "sessionKey": "optional-session-id"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "summaryPrompt": "Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now.\n\nSummarize...",
  "guidelines": "Summarize this session focusing on:\n- Key decisions made\n..."
}
```

The harness should use `summaryPrompt` as the instruction to the model for generating a session summary.

### Configuration

```yaml
hooks:
  preCompaction:
    includeRecentMemories: true  # Include recent memories in prompt
    memoryLimit: 5               # How many recent memories
    summaryGuidelines: |         # Custom summary instructions
      Focus on:
      - Decisions made
      - Code patterns discovered
      - User preferences
```

---

## Compaction Complete Hook

**`POST /api/hooks/compaction-complete`**

Called after compaction with the generated summary. Saves the summary as a
`session_summary` memory row and as a first-class temporal DAG artifact used
by `MEMORY.md`.

Temporal lineage remains agent-scoped. Same `sessionKey` values from
different agents do not share transcript or summary storage.

### Request

```json
{
  "harness": "openclaw",
  "summary": "Session summary text...",
  "sessionKey": "optional-session-id",
  "project": "/workspace/repo"
}
```

If compaction arrives before transcript persistence, `project` is the required
fallback lineage key. When both exist, transcript lineage wins and the request
project is only used as a fallback.

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "memoryId": 123
}
```

---

## MEMORY.md Synthesis

Synthesis regenerates the `MEMORY.md` file by asking an AI model to write a
coherent summary of scored memory and temporal state.

The daemon synthesis worker is the primary runtime path. Harness-scheduled
calls are still supported, but they now write through the same DB-backed,
lease-protected head record. A busy head lease is a deferred write, not a
terminal failure.

### Step 1: Request synthesis

**`POST /api/hooks/synthesis`**

```json
{
  "trigger": "scheduled"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "harness": "openclaw",
  "model": "sonnet",
  "prompt": "You are regenerating MEMORY.md...\n\n## Memories to Synthesize\n...",
  "memories": [...]
}
```

### Step 2: Run the model

The harness runs the prompt through the specified model.

### Step 3: Save the result

**`POST /api/hooks/synthesis/complete`**

```json
{
  "content": "# Memory\n\n## Active Projects\n..."
}
```

The daemon:
1. Backs up the existing MEMORY.md to `memory/MEMORY.backup-<timestamp>.md`
2. Writes the new content with a generation timestamp header
3. Returns `{ "success": true }`

### Configuration

```yaml
memory:
  synthesis:
    harness: openclaw   # which harness runs synthesis
    model: sonnet       # model identifier
    schedule: daily     # daily | weekly | on-demand
    max_tokens: 4000
```

### Get synthesis config

**`GET /api/hooks/synthesis/config`**

Returns the current synthesis configuration. Harnesses can poll this to know when to trigger synthesis.

---

## OpenClaw Integration

The `@signetai/adapter-openclaw` package provides a ready-made plugin:

```javascript
import createPlugin from '@signetai/adapter-openclaw';

const signet = createPlugin({
  enabled: true,
  daemonUrl: 'http://localhost:3850'
});

// In your OpenClaw configuration:
export default {
  plugins: [signet],
};
```

The plugin automatically calls the appropriate hook endpoints at the right lifecycle moments:

```javascript
// Session start — inject memories
const context = await signet.onSessionStart({
  harness: 'openclaw',
  sessionKey: session.id
});
// context.inject → prepend to system prompt

// Pre-compaction — get summary instructions
const guide = await signet.onPreCompaction({
  harness: 'openclaw',
  messageCount: messages.length
});
// Use guide.summaryPrompt as the compaction instruction

// Compaction complete — save summary
await signet.onCompactionComplete({
  harness: 'openclaw',
  summary: generatedSummary
});

// Manual memory operations
await signet.remember('nicholai prefers bun', { who: 'openclaw' });
const results = await signet.recall('coding preferences');
```

In the current OpenClaw plugin runtime, post-compaction persistence may read
the latest compaction summary back from `sessionFile` when the hook payload
only exposes metadata. That keeps compaction artifacts in the same temporal
body as ordinary session-end summaries instead of discarding them.

---

## Claude Code Integration

Claude Code uses file-based hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. The hooks call the Signet CLI, which routes requests through the daemon HTTP API:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "signet hook session-start -H claude-code --project \"$(pwd)\"",
        "timeout": 3000
      }]
    }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "signet hook user-prompt-submit -H claude-code --project \"$(pwd)\"",
        "timeout": 7000
      }]
    }],
    "SessionEnd": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "signet hook session-end -H claude-code",
        "timeout": 15000
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Prompt-submit timeout note: `SIGNET_PROMPT_SUBMIT_TIMEOUT` defaults to
`5000` (daemon wait budget). Claude Code hook config adds a `+2000ms`
grace buffer when written to `settings.json`, so the installed
`UserPromptSubmit` timeout default is `7000`.

Upgrade note: Claude Code hook timeouts are persisted in
`~/.claude/settings.json` during connector install/update. Existing
installs keep old timeout values until you rerun `signet connect
claude-code` (or `signet setup`) to refresh hook config.

The CLI calls the daemon's hook endpoints and outputs context that Claude Code injects into the session.

---

## OpenCode Integration

OpenCode uses a bundled plugin installed by `@signetai/connector-opencode`
at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/signet.mjs`. The plugin calls the daemon
API at session lifecycle events (session-start, user-prompt-submit,
session-end) and exposes `/remember` and `/recall` as native tools.

Install is handled automatically by `signet setup` or `signet connect opencode`.

> **Legacy:** Earlier installations placed a fetch-based `memory.mjs` at
> `~/.config/opencode/memory.mjs`. This path is deprecated. Running
> `signet connect opencode` migrates the installation to the current
> bundled plugin at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/signet.mjs`.

---

## pi Integration

pi uses a bundled extension installed by `@signetai/connector-pi` at
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/signet-pi.js` (or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/extensions/signet-pi.js`).
The extension calls the daemon API at session lifecycle events (session-start,
user-prompt-submit, session-end, compaction) and exposes `/recall`, `/remember`,
and `/signet-status` commands plus `signet_recall`, `signet_source_search`,
`signet_session_search`, and `signet_remember` LLM-callable tools.

Install is handled automatically by `signet setup` or `signet connector install pi`.
For a remote daemon, pass the daemon URL and API key during install:

```bash
signet api-key create --name "work laptop pi" --connector pi --agent-id pi-work-laptop
signet connector install pi \
  --url https://signet-home.tailnet:3850 \
  --api-key sig_sk_... \
  --agent-id pi-work-laptop
```

Configuration is optional via `~/.pi/agent/extensions/signet.json`. Set
`SIGNET_ENABLED=false` to disable for a single session.

---

## Implementing a Custom Hook Client

If you're building a new harness integration, call the hooks directly:

```bash
# Session start
curl -X POST http://localhost:3850/api/hooks/session-start \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"harness": "my-tool"}'

# Pre-compaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:3850/api/hooks/pre-compaction \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"harness": "my-tool", "messageCount": 200}'

# Save compaction summary
curl -X POST http://localhost:3850/api/hooks/compaction-complete \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"harness": "my-tool", "summary": "..."}'
```

The daemon returns JSON at each step. Check `/health` first to verify the daemon is running.

---

## Logs API (Bonus)

The daemon also exposes a real-time log stream via Server-Sent Events:

```
GET /api/logs/stream
```

Useful for harnesses that want to monitor Signet activity without polling:

```javascript
const evtSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:3850/api/logs/stream');
evtSource.onmessage = (e) => {
  const entry = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log(entry.level, entry.message);
};
```

Or fetch recent logs:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3850/api/logs?limit=50&level=warn"
```
