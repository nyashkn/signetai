# Spec Index and Integration Contract

This is the planning control plane for specs and the integration contract
that defines how approved specs compose into a coherent system. If we are
deciding what ships next, this file is the first stop. If we are building
a spec, this file defines how it connects to everything else.

## Cross-Cutting Invariants

These rules apply to ALL approved specs. Any spec that contradicts
these must be updated to conform.

### 1. Agent scoping is universal

Every table that stores user-facing data MUST include an `agent_id`
column. Nothing is global by default. Multi-agent support is not an
afterthought — it is a first-class column from day one.

Tables affected: `memories`, `entities`, `entity_aspects`,
`entity_attributes`, `entity_dependencies`, `skill_meta`, `task_meta`,
`session_checkpoints`, `session_memories`, `predictor_comparisons`.

Note: `entities` (migration 002) predates this invariant and does not
yet have `agent_id`. Migration 019 (KA-1) backfills it. `skill_meta`
(migration 018) already has `agent_id`.

Scoping rule: queries filter by `agent_id` unless explicitly requesting
cross-agent results (e.g., shared skill lookup with allowlist).

The `agent_id` column is infrastructure for database-level tenant
isolation, not a knowledge architecture concern. It exists on every
table for the same reason: so multiple agents sharing the same SQLite
file don't step on each other's data.

Skills are scoped to `agent_id` in the graph. The filesystem pool
(`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/skills/`) is shared, but graph nodes (entity + skill_meta +
embeddings) are per-agent. Each agent gets its own skill entity with its
own usage stats, decay, and relation edges.

### 2. Importance is structural, not arbitrary

`docs/KNOWLEDGE-ARCHITECTURE.md` is authoritative on importance.

Importance is NOT a float assigned by heuristic. It is computed from
structural density:
- Entity importance = f(aspect count, attribute count, constraint count,
  dependency edges, access frequency, user-implied signals)
- Aspect weight = f(attribute density, constraint density, access
  patterns)
- The predictive scorer receives structural density as input features,
  not a pre-computed importance float

The existing `importance` column on `memories` remains for backwards
compatibility and cold-start scoring, but the structural computation
is the source of truth once KA tables are populated.

### 3. Entity type taxonomy is canonical

The knowledge architecture schema defines the canonical entity types:
`person`, `project`, `system`, `tool`, `concept`, `skill`, `task`,
`source`, `artifact`, `agent`, `policy`, `action`, `workflow`, `event`,
`object_type`, `interface`, `observation`, `claim_slot`, `claim_value`,
`unknown`.

All specs that create entities MUST use this taxonomy. Procedural memory
creates `entity_type = 'skill'`. Multi-agent creates agent-scoped
entities. The ontology proposal loop extends KA's canonical taxonomy with
source/proposal lifecycle labels so extraction can model artifacts,
observations, claim slots, and claim values without minting ad-hoc string
categories. The taxonomy is not extensible without updating KA and this
invariant in the same change.

**Planned extension:** DP-14 (Discovered Principles) in the desire
paths epic will add `principle` as an entity type for emergent
cross-entity patterns. This invariant must be updated when DP-14
lands.

### 4. Scorer consumes all available signals

The predictive memory scorer takes every input that exists. Structural
features from KA (entity slot, aspect slot, is_constraint, structural
density), procedural signals (skill usage, decay rate, role), continuity
signals (checkpoint recency, prompt count), behavioral signals (FTS
hits, access patterns), temporal signals (time of day, day of week,
session gap).

More inputs with verifiable grading is always better than curated
inputs. The model learns to ignore irrelevant features. The metric
(NDCG@10 on continuity scores) is the arbiter.

### 5. Constraints always surface

When an entity is in scope during a session, its constraints
(`entity_attributes` where `kind = 'constraint'`) are injected
regardless of score rank. The predictive scorer may rank them but
cannot suppress them. This is a hard retrieval invariant.

---

## Integration Contracts

### Procedural Memory <-> Knowledge Architecture

- Procedural memory creates skill entities with `entity_type = 'skill'`
  and `skill_meta` for runtime behavior (decay rate, use count, fs path,
  role, triggers).
- Knowledge architecture adds `entity_aspects` and `entity_attributes`
  on top. Skills can have aspects (e.g., "deployment capabilities",
  "browser automation features") and attributes organized under those
  aspects.
- KA's `entity_dependencies` captures structural edges between skills
  and other entities (e.g., `skill:wrangler` -> `entity:cloudflare`).
  Procedural memory's `relations` table captures skill-to-skill edges
  (`requires`, `complements`, `often_used_with`).
- Both coexist. `relations` is for skill-specific typed edges.
  `entity_dependencies` is for cross-type structural edges.
- KA structural assignment stage runs AFTER procedural memory creates
  the skill entity. It enriches with aspects/attributes, it does not
  replace skill_meta.

### Procedural Memory <-> Predictive Scorer

- Scorer pre-filter must respect procedural decay rates (`0.99^days`
  with `minImportance` floor) when computing `effectiveScore()` for
  skill-type memories.
- Scorer feature payload includes: `decay_rate`, `use_count`,
  `last_used_at`, `role`, `is_skill` indicator.
- Skills with `minImportance` floor cannot be eliminated during
  pre-filtering. They may rank low but must remain in the candidate
  pool.

### Knowledge Architecture <-> Predictive Scorer

- Traversal-defined candidate pool is the primary retrieval floor.
  Scorer operates on `traversal pool ∪ effectiveScore top-50 ∪
  embedding top-50`.
- Structural features per candidate: `entity_slot` (hashed entity ID),
  `aspect_slot` (hashed primary aspect), `is_constraint` (boolean),
  `structural_density` (aspect count + attribute count for the parent
  entity).
- Scorer evaluation reports include per-entity and per-project slices,
  not only global EMA.
- **Feedback direction (KA-6):** Behavioral signals flow BACK to the
  graph. FTS overlap (memories the user searched for during a session)
  feeds back to aspect weights, confirming which structural bets paid
  off. Per-entity predictor win rates surface as graph health signals.
  Superseded memory labels propagate to entity_attributes status.
  Without this feedback loop, structural weights stagnate and the
  graph diverges from what the user actually needs.
- **Entity pinning (KA-6):** Users can pin entities as always-focal,
  front-loading importance before behavioral evidence accumulates.
  Pinned entities are training data for the predictor — the manual
  exploration mechanism that the predictor eventually learns to
  replicate autonomously. See `docs/KNOWLEDGE-ARCHITECTURE.md`
  section "Love, Hate, and the Exploration Problem" for rationale.

### Knowledge Architecture <-> Session Continuity

- Checkpoint digests include optional structural snapshot: focal
  entities, active aspects, surfaced constraints.
- Recovery injection prioritizes structural snapshots over raw narrative
  when budget is tight.
- Continuity scorer label quality improves when session-end evaluation
  knows which constraints and aspects were in play.

### Signet Runtime <-> Procedural Memory

- Runtime context assembly calls `/api/skills/suggest` (from procedural
  memory spec) to surface relevant skills during session-start and
  optionally per-turn.
- Runtime tool registry discovers installed skills. When a skill is
  invoked, runtime calls `POST /api/skills/used` to record usage.
- Runtime pre-generation research phase may query skill graph for
  domain-relevant capabilities before model generation.

### Signet Runtime <-> Knowledge Architecture

- Runtime session-start calls the traversal retrieval path (KA-3) to
  resolve focal entities and walk their graphs for context assembly.
- Runtime provides project path and session signals that KA uses to
  resolve focal entities.
- Runtime does not implement traversal logic — it calls daemon API
  endpoints that KA defines.

### Desire Paths <-> Knowledge Architecture

- Desire paths builds on the complete KA-1 through KA-6 foundation:
  entity/aspect/attribute hierarchy, graph traversal, behavioral
  feedback loop, entity pinning, constraint surfacing.
- DP-2 (edge confidence) adds `confidence` and `reason` columns to
  `entity_dependencies`. Graph traversal uses `confidence * strength`
  for edge filtering.
- DP-6 (traversal-primary retrieval) inverts the search pipeline so
  graph traversal produces the base candidate pool and flat FTS5 search
  fills gaps. Includes: FTS5 stop-word filtering, agent_id threading
  through graph search, mention-based traversal fallback for memories
  without full pipeline extraction, scope-filtered attribute collection,
  prospective indexing (hypothetical query hints written at memory
  creation time for future retrieval), and cosine re-scoring of
  traversal results against the query embedding. Benchmarked at 62%
  (Signet) vs 68% (RAG) on identical 50-question LoCoMo set — 8 of 12
  Signet failures are shared with RAG (extraction/answer ceiling, not
  retrieval).
- DP-7 (constructed memories) changes traversal output from
  `memoryIds` to structured path objects with provenance metadata.
- DP-14 (discovered principles) adds `principle` to the entity type
  taxonomy. Requires updating invariant 3 when implemented.
- DP-16 (post-fusion dampening) adds gravity, hub, and resolution
  filters after fusion scoring. Informed by Ori-Mnemos ablation data.
  Implemented in `platform/daemon/src/pipeline/dampening.ts`.
- DP-17 (compaction resilience) adds PreCompact/PostCompact checkpoint
  hooks for mid-session context recovery. Extends session continuity.
- DP-18 (decision auto-protection) auto-detects decisions and marks
  them as constraints (invariant 5 ensures they always surface).
  Implemented in `platform/daemon/src/inline-entity-linker.ts` (14
  regex patterns, auto-promotes matching attributes to constraints).
- DP-19 (adaptive write gate) evolves DP-1 significance gate from
  session-level to per-memory surprisal filtering.
- DP-20 (sleep replay) background consolidation discovers latent
  cross-entity connections during idle periods.

### Desire Paths <-> Predictive Scorer

- DP-8 (predictor bug fixes) is a prerequisite: fixes the 3 critical
  bugs blocking enablement.
- DP-10 (path scoring) evolves the scorer from ranking individual
  memories to ranking traversal paths. Feature vector changes from
  per-memory signals to per-path signals (hop count, min edge
  confidence, average aspect weight, community boundary crossing).
- DP-9 (path feedback) changes training signal from "was this memory
  useful?" to "was this traversal path useful?" — propagating ratings
  along edges, upgrading/downgrading confidence/reason.
- This is the convergence point described in `docs/specs/planning/DESIRE-PATHS.md`:
  the scorer provides learning signal, the graph provides structure
  to propagate it.

### Ontology Evolution Core <-> Desire Paths

- Traversal ranking consumes `confidence`, `reason`, and co-occurrence
  association signals where present, with bounded fallback to existing
  confidence-strength scoring when absent.
- Typed relationship taxonomy is introduced behind compatibility mapping;
  legacy edges remain queryable until strict mode is enabled.
- Constraint surfacing invariant remains a hard override regardless of
  ontology edge rank.

### Ontology Evolution Core <-> Retroactive Supersession

- Attribute supersession and memory lineage stay synchronized: when a new
  fact supersedes an old fact, latest-truth retrieval prefers the newest
  node while preserving full chain expansion for audit/history.
- Constraints (`kind='constraint'`) are excluded from auto-supersession,
  unchanged from invariant 5.

### Ontology Governance Workflow <-> INDEX / CI

- Any ontology-impacting schema PR must update: spec file, `dependencies.yaml`,
  and this index registry in the same change.
- CI contract checks block merge on ID/status/path drift between INDEX and
  dependencies metadata.
- Medium/high-risk ontology changes require explicit compatibility and rollback
  notes before promotion from planning to approved.

### SSM Track <-> Retrieval and Ontology Contracts

- `ssm-foundation-evaluation` defines benchmark and canary gates. No SSM
  routing may become default until these gates are green and repeatable.
- `ssm-temporal-backbone` runs in shadow mode first. Production retrieval
  remains deterministic with existing scorer fallback.
- `ssm-graph-traversal-model` may re-rank traversal paths but cannot alter
  traversal bounds, agent scoping, or constraint surfacing invariants.
- SSM features consume ontology signals (`confidence`, relationship type,
  co-occurrence, lineage) when available. `ontology-evolution-core` is a
  soft dependency for `ssm-temporal-backbone` and `ssm-graph-traversal-model`
  (both handle missing signals gracefully with zero defaults) and is not
  required by `ssm-foundation-evaluation`.

### Engram-Informed Predictor Track <-> SSM Track

- `engram-informed-predictor-track` is the translation lane for Engram
  patterns into Signet scorer experiments and SSM-ready contracts.
- No `ssm-temporal-backbone` rollout may claim Engram alignment until this
  track records accepted/rejected deltas and benchmark evidence.
- The track cannot violate existing runtime guarantees: fail-open scoring,
  deterministic fallback, bounded latency, and constraint surfacing.

### Dreaming Memory Consolidation <-> Knowledge Architecture

- Dreaming reads the full entity graph (entities, aspects, attributes,
  dependencies) as input to reasoning passes.
- Dreaming writes graph mutations through the same KA schema: creates,
  merges, deletes entities; updates/deletes aspects; supersedes/creates/
  deletes attributes; rewrites dependency edges during merges.
- Pinned entities (KA-6) cannot be deleted by dreaming — enforced at
  mutation application time, reported as `skipped`.
- Constraint attributes (`kind='constraint'`) cannot be superseded or
  deleted by dreaming — invariant 5 holds.
- Dreaming does not modify memories, embeddings, or retention state.
  It only mutates the entity graph layer.

### Dreaming Memory Consolidation <-> Session Continuity

- Dreaming token accumulation hooks into the summary worker: each
  session summary's transcript token count feeds `dreaming_state`.
- Phase 2 will make dreaming passes into real sessions (session-start,
  transcript, session-end summary), creating a self-improvement loop
  where dream pass N+1 can review dream pass N's decisions.
- Until Phase 2, dreaming passes are standalone LLM calls with no
  session continuity or memory of prior passes.

### Dreaming Memory Consolidation <-> Pipeline V2

- Phase 1: dreaming and Pipeline V2 can run concurrently. SQLite write
  serialization prevents data corruption but not logical inconsistency
  (extraction may create entities between dreaming's read and write).
- Phase 2 contract: when `dreaming.enabled: true`, Pipeline V2
  extraction workers should be OFF. One knowledge graph writer at a
  time. Summary workers and retention continue regardless.
- Pipeline V2 remains the default for users without dreaming configured.
  Dreaming is opt-in and requires a capable model provider.

### Multi-Agent <-> All Specs

- `agent_id` column appears on every data table (see invariant 1).
- Agent roster in `agent.yaml` under `agents.roster` defines which agents exist.
- Identity inheritance: agent subdirs (`~/.agents/agents/{name}/`) override
  root-level files. Only `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md` are per-agent by default;
  `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, `TOOLS.md` inherit from root.
- Skills: shared filesystem pool, per-agent graph nodes and usage stats.
- Memory queries include agent scope filter based on per-agent read policy:
  - `isolated`: only own memories
  - `shared`: all `visibility=global` memories + own private
  - `group`: `visibility=global` from group members + own private
- `visibility` column on `memories` (`global`/`private`/`archived`) is the
  per-memory access flag. Separate from `scope` (benchmark namespacing).
- OpenClaw session key format `agent:{id}:{rest}` is auto-parsed by
  `resolveAgentId()` — no extra config needed for OpenClaw users.
- The daemon serves both single-agent and multi-agent installs. All new
  API params are optional with sensible defaults (no `agentId` =
  `"default"` agent = current single-agent behavior).

## Success Criteria

What "done" looks like for each spec — observable outcomes, not just
code merged.

**memory-pipeline-v2**: Memory extraction captures context that was
previously lost between sessions. Pipeline processes hook payloads
without blocking agent response time.

**session-continuity-protocol**: Agent recovers meaningful context
when resuming after session compaction or restart.

**knowledge-architecture-schema**: Memory retrieval returns
structurally related context, not just embedding-similar fragments.
Entity graph traversal produces richer context than flat embedding
search alone.

**predictive-memory-scorer**: Session-start context relevance
improves over time without manual curation. NDCG@10 on continuity
scores is the quantitative metric.

**pipeline-pause-control**: Operators can pause extraction work from
the CLI or dashboard to free resources without dropping future backlog
processing, then resume normal draining later, with live daemon
control when available.

**desire-paths-epic**: Graph traversal discovers relevant memories
that embedding search alone misses. Path feedback propagates learning
signal through entity dependency edges.

**procedural-memory-plan**: Installed skills are represented as graph
entities with usage tracking and decay. Skill suggestions surface
relevant capabilities during sessions.

**signet-runtime**: Signet operates as a standalone runtime channel
independent of harness-specific connectors.

**multi-agent-support**: Multiple agents share one SQLite database
without data collision via agent_id scoping.

**sub-agent-context-continuity**: Parent session transcript is queryable during active sessions, and sub-agents inherit deterministic parent context with no LLM call.


**ontology-evolution-core**: Ontology retrieval uses confidence/provenance
and normalized association signals to improve path quality while preserving
constraint surfacing and agent scoping invariants.

**ontology-governance-workflow**: Ontology-impacting schema changes require
proposal/review metadata, compatibility notes, and rollback guidance with
INDEX/dependency consistency checks in CI.

**ontology-proposal-loop**: Extraction and consolidation produce durable,
agent-scoped proposal objects before ontology mutation. Operators and agents
can inspect, apply, or reject proposed semantic changes with evidence and audit
metadata preserved.

**ssm-foundation-evaluation**: SSM benchmarks and canary suites produce
reproducible, decision-grade comparisons against current scorer behavior.

**engram-informed-predictor-track**: Engram-inspired scorer ablations
produce reproducible quality and latency evidence, and accepted deltas are
explicitly handed off into SSM temporal planning contracts.

**ssm-temporal-backbone**: Temporal SSM shadow scoring improves long-gap
and supersession-sensitive ranking slices while preserving deterministic
fallback and latency bounds.

**ssm-graph-traversal-model**: SSM path reranking improves multi-hop
ranking quality without violating traversal bounds, agent scoping, or
constraint surfacing invariants.


**dreaming-memory-consolidation**: Entity graph density increases after
a dreaming pass. Duplicate and near-duplicate entities are merged
automatically. Stale or junk attributes are pruned without manual
intervention. Token spend per pass is bounded and configurable. Phase 1
(mechanical consolidation engine) is delivered. Phase 2 (dreaming as a
session, incremental deltas, pipeline mutual exclusion, chunked
compaction, dashboard observability, identity context injection) is
required before spec moves to `complete`.

**wave-9 strategic stubs**: The strategic backlog items listed in Wave 9
are intentionally tracked as planning stubs and require dedicated planning
spec expansion before implementation starts.


**wave-10 devex/cicd stubs**: CI/CD acceleration and workflow quality items
are tracked as planning stubs and should be promoted in priority order as
team bandwidth allows.

## Dependency Tracking Rules

1. Every new spec gets a stable ID and entry in `dependencies.yaml`.
2. If a spec introduces a new hard dependency, update both:
   - `docs/specs/dependencies.yaml`
   - this file's registry and graph if the dependency is on the critical path.
3. Hard dependency means: implementation work should not merge ahead of the
   dependency unless explicitly marked partial/spike.
4. Soft dependency means: work can run in parallel, but interfaces must be
   locked before GA.
5. Cross-cutting invariants (above) override individual spec decisions.
   If a spec contradicts an invariant, the spec must be updated.

Validation command:
- `bun scripts/spec-deps-check.ts`
- Script: `scripts/spec-deps-check.ts`
- Checks: unknown IDs, hard-dependency cycles, missing spec paths,
  and `INDEX.md` <-> `dependencies.yaml` drift (ID/status/path).
