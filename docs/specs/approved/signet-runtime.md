Signet Runtime Adapter Contract
===============================

Context
-------

Signet currently runs as a cognitive maintenance layer on top of external
runtimes — OpenClaw, Claude Code, OpenCode. These are first-class harness
integrations and remain so. The problem is that Signet's capability growth
is gated on what each harness exposes: if a harness deprecates a plugin
interface, changes its hook model, or simply doesn't support a new
lifecycle event, Signet loses the surface.

The deeper issue is definitional. Every harness integration has to answer
the question "what does a Signet harness need to implement?" — right now
there is no canonical answer. Each connector is a bespoke translation layer.

The solution is a daemon-owned adapter contract that defines what it means to
run a harness on Signet. When the daemon adds a new lifecycle capability, each
harness adapter has a clear spec to implement against. The daemon API is the
source of truth for the integration contract.

Key constraints:
- All actions in the runtime are Daemon API calls first. The runtime is a
  thin orchestration layer over the daemon HTTP API, not a parallel
  implementation of daemon functionality.
- Harnesses are thin clients. They translate platform-specific events into
  Daemon API calls using the same interfaces the reference runtime uses.
- SDKs for TypeScript, Rust, and Python continue to be first-class. The
  runtime expands what the SDKs expose, not replaces them.


What the Runtime Is
-------------------

The Signet runtime is a session execution loop that:

1. Assembles context (memory injection, system prompt, identity) via daemon
2. Sends a turn to a configured LLM provider
3. Dispatches tool calls through a registered tool registry
4. Manages the session lifecycle (start, prompt, end, compaction)
5. Records behavioral signals back to the daemon (FTS hits, continuity)

Every one of those steps is a daemon API call or a thin wrapper around one.
The runtime doesn't store state — the daemon does.

The runtime's only owned concern is the execution loop: taking a user
message, assembling what the agent needs to respond, calling the model,
handling tools, and returning output. Everything else is delegated.


Core Interfaces
---------------

These interfaces define the integration contract. Implementing them is what
it means to be a Signet harness.

### Provider

```typescript
interface Provider {
  id: string
  complete(messages: Message[], opts?: CompletionOptions): Promise<CompletionResult>
  stream(messages: Message[], opts?: CompletionOptions): AsyncIterable<CompletionChunk>
  available(): Promise<boolean>
}

interface CompletionOptions {
  model?: string
  maxTokens?: number
  temperature?: number
  tools?: ToolDefinition[]
  systemPrompt?: string
}

interface CompletionResult {
  content: string
  toolCalls?: ToolCall[]
  stopReason: 'end_turn' | 'tool_use' | 'max_tokens' | 'stop_sequence'
  usage: { inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number }
}
```

Implementations: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible (Ollama, local).
The runtime ships a default Anthropic provider. Additional providers are
registered at startup or loaded from config.

### Tool

```typescript
interface Tool {
  name: string
  description: string
  inputSchema: JsonSchema
  runBeforeGeneration?: boolean  // opt-in to pre-generation research phase
  execute(input: unknown, context: ToolContext): Promise<unknown>
}

interface ToolContext {
  sessionKey: string
  project: string
  daemonUrl: string  // all daemon calls go through context, never direct
}
```

Tools are registered in a `ToolRegistry`. The runtime dispatches tool calls
from model responses through the registry. Built-in tools: `memory_search`,
`memory_store`, `memory_get`, `memory_modify`, `memory_forget` — thin
wrappers over daemon API endpoints, identical to what the MCP server exposes.

### Channel

```typescript
interface Channel {
  kind: string
  receive(): Promise<UserTurn>
  send(output: AgentOutput): Promise<void>
  onClose(handler: () => void): void
}

interface UserTurn {
  content: string
  attachments?: Attachment[]
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
}

interface AgentOutput {
  content: string
  toolResults?: ToolResult[]
  streaming?: boolean
}
```

First channel: CLI (stdin/stdout). Subsequent: HTTP (for harness adapter
attachment). Channel is the only interface that varies between the reference
runtime and a harness adapter — everything else (provider, tools, lifecycle)
is identical.

### RuntimeAdapter

This is the interface a harness implements to integrate with Signet. It maps
platform-specific lifecycle events to daemon API calls.

```typescript
interface RuntimeAdapter {
  harness: string  // 'openclaw' | 'claude-code' | 'opencode' | ...

  onSessionStart(params: SessionStartParams): Promise<SessionStartResult>
  onUserPromptSubmit(params: PromptSubmitParams): Promise<PromptSubmitResult>
  onSessionEnd(params: SessionEndParams): Promise<void>
  onPreCompaction(params: PreCompactionParams): Promise<PreCompactionResult>
  onCompactionComplete(params: CompactionCompleteParams): Promise<void>
}
```

All `RuntimeAdapter` implementations are thin clients: every method body is
a daemon API call. OpenClaw's adapter implements this interface by calling
the same daemon endpoints via its plugin system; other adapters translate
their own lifecycle hooks into the same calls.

A harness adapter is a `RuntimeAdapter` implementation. Nothing more.


Package Structure
-----------------

Signet does not maintain a monorepo-owned native runtime package. Runtime
coverage is provided by connector and plugin packages under `integrations/*`,
with daemon endpoints as the shared contract.


Session Lifecycle
-----------------

Each turn in the execution loop:

```
1. Channel.receive()
     → get user message

2. executor.preGeneration()   [research phase]
     → query daemon for relevant memories (FTS + vector)
     → execute tools with runBeforeGeneration: true
     → results available to model before generation starts

3. context.assemble()
     → system prompt: identity + SOUL.md content + injected memories
     → conversation history
     → pre-generation tool results

4. Provider.complete()
     → call the model with assembled context

5. executor.dispatch()        [tool loop]
     → for each tool call in response: ToolRegistry.execute()
     → append results to messages
     → loop back to Provider.complete() until stop_reason = end_turn

6. daemon POST /api/hooks/user-prompt-submit
     → record FTS hits for behavioral signals (predictive scorer training)

7. Channel.send()
     → deliver output to user
```

Session start:
```
daemon POST /api/hooks/session-start
  → memories injected into first-turn system prompt
  → continuity checkpoint loaded if session resumed
```

Session end:
```
daemon POST /api/hooks/session-end
  → triggers continuity scoring job
  → memory extraction pipeline enqueued
  → session checkpoint saved
```

The pre-generation research phase (step 2) is the key architectural
difference from a naive chat loop. Tools that declare `runBeforeGeneration:
true` execute before the model sees the user message. The model gets
grounded context instead of generating then correcting.


Daemon API Dependency Map
--------------------------

Every runtime action maps to a daemon endpoint. This table defines the
integration surface a harness adapter must cover for full parity:

| Runtime Action              | Daemon Endpoint                      | Phase |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Session start context       | POST /api/hooks/session-start        | start |
| Per-prompt context + FTS    | POST /api/hooks/user-prompt-submit   | turn  |
| Session end / extraction    | POST /api/hooks/session-end          | end   |
| Pre-compaction summary      | POST /api/hooks/pre-compaction       | cmpct |
| Save compaction result      | POST /api/hooks/compaction-complete  | cmpct |
| Memory search (tool)        | POST /api/memory/recall              | any   |
| Memory store (tool)         | POST /api/hooks/remember             | any   |
| Memory get (tool)           | GET  /api/memory/:id                 | any   |
| Memory modify (tool)        | POST /api/memory/modify              | any   |
| Memory forget (tool)        | POST /api/memory/forget              | any   |
| Secret injection            | POST /api/secrets/exec               | tool  |
| Daemon health check         | GET  /health                         | start |

A harness adapter that covers all rows has full parity with the reference
runtime. Partial coverage is valid — the delta is explicit and auditable.


SDK Surface Additions
---------------------

The runtime expands SDK surface without breaking existing API.

**TypeScript SDK (@signet/sdk)**

New exports:
- `RuntimeAdapter` interface
- `createAdapter(harness, daemonUrl?)` — factory returning a pre-wired
  client implementing each lifecycle method as a daemon API call
- `RuntimeAdapterServer` — HTTP server exposing adapter lifecycle as
  endpoints (for harnesses that prefer HTTP over library import)

**Rust SDK**

- `RuntimeAdapter` trait
- `AdapterClient` struct — pre-wired daemon HTTP client
- `RuntimeAdapterServer` — axum-based server for HTTP attachment

**Python SDK**

- `RuntimeAdapter` abstract base class
- `AdapterClient` — aiohttp-based daemon client
- `RuntimeAdapterServer` — FastAPI-based server for HTTP attachment

Any harness in any language can implement `RuntimeAdapter` using the
appropriate SDK, call the same daemon endpoints, and have full parity
with the reference runtime.


Harness Adapter Pattern
-----------------------

An adapter is a translation layer with no business logic. Example:

```typescript
// @signetai/adapter-openclaw — full implementation
import { createAdapter } from '@signet/sdk'

export default function createPlugin(opts: { daemonUrl?: string }) {
  const adapter = createAdapter('openclaw', opts.daemonUrl)

  return {
    onSessionStart:     (ctx) => adapter.onSessionStart({
      sessionKey: ctx.session.id, project: ctx.workspace
    }),
    onUserPromptSubmit: (ctx) => adapter.onUserPromptSubmit({
      sessionKey: ctx.session.id, prompt: ctx.prompt
    }),
    onSessionEnd:       (ctx) => adapter.onSessionEnd({
      sessionKey: ctx.session.id
    }),
    onPreCompaction:    (ctx) => adapter.onPreCompaction({
      sessionKey: ctx.session.id, messageCount: ctx.messages.length
    }),
    onCompactionComplete: (ctx) => adapter.onCompactionComplete({
      sessionKey: ctx.session.id, summary: ctx.summary
    }),
  }
}
```

When Signet adds a new capability, it adds a daemon endpoint and a new
`RuntimeAdapter` method. Each harness adapter adds one translation. There is
no duplicated business logic to reason about or diverge.


Build Sequence
--------------

**Phase 1: daemon-owned contract**
- Preserve the daemon-owned execution contract: memory, hooks, secrets, and session state stay daemon-side
- Deliverable: supported harnesses share the same lifecycle semantics where their host APIs allow it

**Phase 2: harness parity**
- Keep Bun daemon, Rust daemon, and existing harness adapters aligned on the same daemon endpoints
- Treat external harnesses as thin adapters over the same runtime contract
- Deliverable: integration deltas are explicit and auditable

**Phase 3: SDK adapter ergonomics**
- Add or refine adapter helpers in the SDKs so external harnesses can implement the runtime contract with less boilerplate
- Keep adapter logic translation-only; business logic stays in the daemon/runtime boundary
- Deliverable: new harness integrations have a minimal documented path

**Phase 4: optional runtime transport expansion**
- If a supported harness exposes a stable local API, document it as an extension of the same runtime contract instead of a separate architecture
- Deliverable: transport choices can evolve without changing the core daemon contract


What This Is Not
----------------

- Not a replacement for the daemon. All state lives in the daemon.
  The runtime is stateless at the contract boundary.
- Not a new memory system. Memory is still pipeline v2 + predictive scorer
  + knowledge graph, owned by the daemon.
- Not breaking for existing harnesses. OpenClaw/Claude Code/OpenCode work
  through their own adapters and remain additive integrations.
- Not a config system. Config lives in agent.yaml, read by the daemon.


Critical Files
--------------

Runtime contract + adapters:
- `libs/sdk/`
- `integrations/openclaw/connector/`
- `integrations/claude-code/connector/`
- `integrations/opencode/connector/`

Daemon surfaces:
- `platform/daemon/`
- `platform/daemon-rs/`


Open Questions
--------------

1. **Provider config** — provider selection and model live in agent.yaml.
   Keep the runtime-facing schema minimal and daemon-owned.

2. **Multi-provider routing** — route different task types to different
   providers when there is a concrete need, not as a prerequisite for the
   reference runtime.

3. **Streaming in adapters** — adapters should continue to translate
   lifecycle hooks cleanly without taking ownership of core runtime state.

4. **Tool sandboxing** — third-party tools run in-process by default.
   Consider stronger isolation only when the third-party tool surface grows.

5. **Session resume** — checkpoints stay daemon-owned; document resume
   behavior consistently across supported harnesses.
