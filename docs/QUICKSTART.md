Why Signet
---

Your agent starts every session from zero. It doesn't know what you
worked on yesterday. It doesn't know your preferences, your projects,
or the decisions you've already made together. Every session is a
first date.

The industry's answer to this has often been to give agents memory tools
— "remember this," "recall that." That's not memory. That's a filing
cabinet the agent sometimes opens. It puts the LLM in charge of
micromanaging what to store and when to retrieve it.

Signet takes a different approach. The goal is ambient context
selection: turn interactions into durable memory substrate, preserve the
record of what actually happened, and surface the right pieces when the
next session begins.

### The distillation layer

At the end of every conversation, Signet reviews the session and
distills it. A local LLM breaks the conversation into atomic facts,
checks them against what's already known, and decides whether to add new
facts, skip duplicates, or record proposals for more complex changes.
Your agent won't store "prefers dark mode" fourteen times.

### The knowledge graph

Named entities — people, projects, tools, concepts — are extracted
and linked. When you ask about a project, Signet traverses the graph:
the project's architecture, the people involved, the tools it depends
on, the constraints that apply. This structure improves the quality of
candidate context instead of treating memory as a flat pile of fragments.

### Context selection

The structured candidate pool gives Signet something better than a flat
list of snippets. Retrieval can combine graph traversal, keyword search,
semantic similarity, provenance, scope, recency, and feedback without
hiding the result behind an opaque ranking model.

The aim is practical precision: surface the context that helps the agent
work now, and keep noisy or repeatedly unhelpful memories from haunting
the context window forever.

### Retrieval

Retrieval blends graph traversal, keyword search, and semantic
similarity into a bounded candidate set, then reranks and filters it.
The constellation view in the dashboard lets you inspect the agent's
knowledge topology.

### Document ingest

Feed any document into the distillation layer. PDFs, specs, reference
pages, URLs. They're chunked, embedded, and indexed alongside your
agent's insights.

### Safety guarantees

- **Raw-first**: content is persisted before any LLM processing begins
- **Pinned insights are sacred**: the distillation layer cannot modify
  them. Only you can.
- **Everything is recoverable**: deletions are soft, with a recovery
  window and full audit trail

Automatic destructive memory mutations remain conservative and gated in
the current implementation. Explicit user/operator repair flows are the
reliable path today.

The same agent follows you across Claude Code, OpenCode, and OpenClaw.
Same personality, same knowledge, same secrets. Switch tools without
starting over.

vision, see [VISION.md](../VISION.md).

Prerequisites
---

- macOS or Linux
- Embeddings (choose one):
  - Built-in (recommended, no extra setup)
  - Ollama (local)
  - OpenAI API key
- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+ only if you choose the npm or Bun wrapper instead
  of the direct native binary installer

---

Install
---

Quickstart is for installing and using Signet. If you want to work on
Signet itself from source, use the contributor workflow in
[Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) instead of the install paths below.

```bash
# direct native binary
curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash

# npm wrapper for the same compiled Signet binary
npm install -g signetai

# Bun wrapper for the same compiled Signet binary
bun add -g signetai
```

Running `signet setup` launches an interactive wizard that walks you through
the full setup. You don't need to read anything else first.

All three install paths install the same compiled Signet binary. The npm and
Bun paths install the `signetai` package with bundled native assets for the
supported platforms. Install scripts only link the bundled binary into place; if
scripts are disabled, the wrapper resolves the bundled binary directly. They do
not install Bun, rebuild Signet, or install daemon dependencies.
Published native binaries currently cover Linux x64, Linux arm64, macOS x64,
macOS arm64, and Windows x64. Windows direct installs should use
`npm install -g signetai`; the old PowerShell `install.ps1` path has been
removed until a native Windows direct installer ships.

For agent-driven onboarding, use non-interactive mode:

```bash
signet setup --non-interactive \
  --name "My Agent" \
  --harness claude-code \
  --deployment-type vps \
  --embedding-provider native
```

`--deployment-type` supports `local`, `vps`, or `server` and adjusts inferred
defaults when provider flags are omitted. Explicit provider flags always
override inferred defaults.

Agents can also run install and setup in one command, but only with explicit
setup choices:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- --help

curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash -s -- -- \
  --name "My Agent" \
  --harness claude-code \
  --deployment-type local \
  --embedding-provider native \
  --extraction-provider claude-code
```

If an agent does not have those choices yet, install first and run
`signet setup` after asking the user.

Signet Secrets is a bundled core plugin and is enabled by default for existing
workspaces. New interactive installs include a **Core plugins** step that
explains what it does before asking whether to enable it. For automation, pass
`--disable-signet-secrets` if you want the plugin installed but disabled.

GraphIQ is an optional verified managed plugin for fast local code retrieval.
It is not installed by default. Interactive setup asks whether to install it;
automation can pass `--with-graphiq` to install via script from GitHub releases,
fallback, or `--disable-graphiq` to keep it disabled.

If OpenClaw is configured to use the same workspace path, setup now enforces
backup posture before finishing. In automation, either configure a git
`origin` remote ahead of time, or pass `--create-local-backup` (or
`--allow-unprotected-workspace` if you intentionally accept the risk).
Snapshot-backed protection is considered fresh for 7 days; after that, run
setup with `--create-local-backup` again or configure `origin`.

Extraction safety note:

- intended usage is Claude Code on Haiku, Codex CLI on gpt-5.4-mini with a
  Pro/Max subscription, or local Ollama with at least `qwen3:4b`
- with `--deployment-type vps`, setup prefers non-local extraction defaults
  from selected harnesses when those tools are available locally, then other
  detected tooling, and avoids defaulting to local Ollama extraction
- on a VPS, set extraction to `none` if you do not want background LLM calls
- remote API extraction can rack up extreme fees fast

---

Setup Wizard
---

The wizard asks a series of questions:

**1. Agent name**

Pick a name for your agent — this appears in harness prompts and the
dashboard.

**2. Harnesses**

Select which AI platforms you use. Signet will configure integrations
for each:

- Claude Code — hooks + CLAUDE.md sync
- OpenCode — plugin + AGENTS.md sync
- OpenClaw — adapter-openclaw hooks
- Codex — wrapper install + session hooks

**3. Agent description**

Add a short description of your agent. This is used in generated identity
metadata and dashboard summaries.

**4. Core plugins**

Signet Secrets stores reusable credentials outside chat, memory, logs, and
source files. It connects to Signet's encrypted local store and compatible
1Password references, then exposes value-safe CLI, MCP, and SDK helpers plus
command injection with output redaction. This is safer than pasting API keys
into prompts because agents can list secret names and run commands with
injected values without reading the raw secrets.

**5. Optional code retrieval**

GraphIQ can index active projects into each project's local `.graphiq/`
directory and expose generic code retrieval tools through Signet. Use it when
you want fast symbol search, structural context, constants, and blast-radius
analysis alongside Signet memory retrieval.

After setup, index a project with:

```bash
signet index ~/signet/signetai
```

That path becomes the active code project for GraphIQ-backed MCP tools until
another `signet index <path>` command changes it.

**6. Deployment context**

Choose where Signet is running (`local`, `vps`, `server`). Setup uses
this to show guidance before extraction provider selection.

**7. Embedding provider**

Embeddings power semantic (meaning-based) memory search. Choose:

- **Built-in** (recommended) — no extra setup required.
- **Ollama** — runs locally, free, no API key needed.
  Setup checks your binary, service, and model, and guides install/pull
  when needed.
- **OpenAI** — uses the OpenAI embeddings API. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Skip** — memory still works via keyword search, just no semantic search.

**8. Embedding model**

For Ollama, `nomic-embed-text` is a good default. Setup can pull it for
you (with confirmation), or you can do it manually:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

**9. Search balance**

The `alpha` setting controls how much weight goes to semantic vs. keyword
search. 0.7 (70% semantic, 30% keyword) works well for most people.

**9. Git & auto-commit**

The wizard can initialize a git repo in `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/` so every change to
your agent files is automatically versioned.

Setup also clones a managed Signet source checkout into
`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/signetai/`. Future `signet update` and `signet sync`
operations fetch the latest upstream changes, but they only auto-pull when that
checkout is clean and still sitting on the default branch. If you are hacking on
the internals locally, Signet fetches and leaves your changes alone.

After the wizard completes, the [[daemon]] starts automatically and the
[[dashboard]] opens at `http://localhost:3850`.

What Signet Does
---

Once running, Signet gives you a persistent agent identity that works
across all your AI tools. The core features:

- **[[pipeline|Memory pipeline]]** — conversations are processed automatically by
  Pipeline V2, which extracts meaningful facts and decisions using a
  configured extraction backend. The safe intended setups are Claude
  Code on Haiku, Codex on gpt-5.4-mini, or local Ollama with at least
  `qwen3:4b`. Set the extraction provider to `none` if you want Signet
  without background extraction. Memories accumulate over time and are
  recalled in future sessions.
- **Hybrid search** — recall combines semantic and keyword search so
  you find relevant memories even when phrasing varies.
- **Connectors** — platform adapters for Claude Code, OpenCode, and
  OpenClaw keep your agent config in sync across tools.
- **Analytics** — the dashboard tracks memory growth, session activity,
  and pipeline health over time.
- **Document ingest** — feed local files or URLs into the memory pipeline
  to give your agent persistent knowledge about a codebase, spec, or doc.
- **Diagnostics** — built-in health checks and pipeline status endpoints
  help you spot issues fast.
- **SDK** — embed Signet into your own apps via `@signet/sdk`.
- **Secrets** — API keys stored encrypted at rest, never exposed to agents
  directly.
- **Skills** — installable instruction packages that extend agent behavior.
- **Auth** — token-based access control for local, team, and hybrid
  deployments. See [Auth](./AUTH.md) for details.

Basic Usage
---

### Check status

```bash
signet status
```

Shows daemon state, file health, and memory count.

### Open the dashboard

```bash
signet dashboard
```

Opens `http://localhost:3850` in your browser. From here you can edit
your agent config, browse memories, view analytics, and manage skills.
You can also reach it directly in your browser any time the daemon is
running.

### Save a memory

Use the CLI or `/remember` command in any connected harness:

```bash
# CLI
signet remember "nicholai prefers bun over npm"
signet remember "critical memory" --critical
signet remember "tagged memory" -t project,signet

# In harness
/remember nicholai prefers bun over npm
/remember critical: never commit secrets to git
/remember [project,signet]: daemon runs on port 3850
```

The `critical:` prefix or `--critical` flag pins a memory so it never
decays. The `[tag1,tag2]:` prefix or `-t` flag adds searchable tags.

You can also let the pipeline do this automatically — at the end of a
session, Pipeline V2 reads the conversation and extracts memories on its
own. Manual `/remember` is for things you want to ensure are captured.

### Search memories

```bash
# CLI
signet recall "coding preferences"
signet recall "signet" --type decision -l 5

# In harness
/recall coding preferences
/recall signet architecture
/recall what did we decide about authentication
```

### View daemon logs

```bash
signet daemon logs
signet daemon logs -n 100
```

### Stop/start the daemon

```bash
signet daemon stop
signet daemon start
signet daemon restart
```

---

Managing Secrets
---

Store API keys and other sensitive values encrypted at rest:

```bash
# Add a secret (value is never echoed)
signet secret put OPENAI_API_KEY

# List stored secrets (names only)
signet secret list

# Remove a secret
signet secret delete GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Secrets are encrypted with libsodium using a machine-bound key. Agents
never see secret values directly.

---

Managing Skills
---

Skills are packaged instructions in `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/skills/`. They extend
what your agent can do.

```bash
# See what's installed
signet skill list

# Search the skills.sh registry
signet skill search browser

# Install a skill
signet skill install browser-use

# Remove a skill
signet skill remove weather
```

---

Install as a System Service
---

To have Signet start automatically on boot:

```bash
cd platform/daemon
bun run install:service
```

**macOS (launchd):**
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.signet.daemon.plist
```

**Linux (systemd):**
```bash
systemctl --user enable signet.service
systemctl --user start signet.service
```

---

Editing Your Agent
---

Your agent identity lives in four self-managed files:

**`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/AGENTS.md`** — How the agent operates, including rules,
workflow, and constraints. This is the main file that syncs to harnesses.

**`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/SOUL.md`** — Personality, voice, values, and temperament.

**`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/IDENTITY.md`** — Who the agent is.

**`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/USER.md`** — Who you are to the agent, plus preferences
and relationship context.

These files are meant to be maintained over time as durable context.

**`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/MEMORY.md`** is different. It is auto-generated by
Signet as episodic and operational memory. Do not edit it manually.

Edit the four identity files directly in your editor or via the dashboard's
config editor. Changes sync to harnesses automatically within 2 seconds.

---

Auth and Team Deployments
---

By default, Signet runs in local mode with no auth required on
requests. In the default local setup, the daemon also binds to
localhost only, which keeps that unauthenticated mode local by default.
For team deployments or self-hosted remote access, Signet supports
token-based auth with roles and scopes. See [Auth](./AUTH.md) and
[Self-Hosting](./SELF-HOSTING.md) for setup details.

---

Troubleshooting
---

**Daemon won't start**

Check if port 3850 is in use:
```bash
lsof -i :3850
```

Remove a stale PID file if needed:
```bash
rm $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/pid
signet daemon start
```

**Embeddings not working**

Make sure Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama serve &
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Or check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment (or stored
as a secret and referenced in `agent.yaml`).

**Changes not syncing to Claude Code**

Make sure `~/.claude/` exists and you have the harness configured:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
signet status
```

**Dashboard not loading**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3850/health
signet daemon logs
```
