Dashboard
=========

The Signet dashboard is a Svelte 5 + Vite static app served by the [[daemon]] at
`http://localhost:3850`. It is a supplementary visual interface — useful
for browsing [[memory]], editing config files, and inspecting daemon state,
but not the primary way to interact with Signet. The [[cli|CLI]] and
[[harnesses|harness]] integrations are the primary interfaces.


Accessing the Dashboard
-----------------------

The daemon must be running first:

```bash
signet daemon start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3850` in your browser, or run:

```bash
signet dashboard
```

The `signet dashboard` command opens your default browser. If the daemon
is not already running, it starts it first.


Layout
------

The dashboard is a single-page app with a collapsible left navigation rail and
a main workspace.

- **Left navigation rail** — Overview, Ontology, Tasks, Audit, Secrets,
  Skills, Sources, Settings, theme toggle, and project/release access.
- **Main workspace** — lazy-loaded dashboard surfaces for the selected area.

The sidebar footer shows the daemon version and pending restart state when
available.


Left Sidebar
------------

The sidebar is intentionally navigation-only. Identity, harness, config,
pipeline, connector, and log details live inside Overview, Ontology, Settings,
and Audit surfaces rather than as separate sidebar panels.


Tabs
----

**Overview** — Home surface for daemon status, memory health, harness state,
marketplace spotlights, pinned entity clusters, and upgrade/restart signals.

**Ontology** — Unified memory workspace. It combines memory search, timeline,
knowledge/entity inspection, and constellation/embedding exploration behind
the `cortex-memory` route. Legacy hashes such as `#memory`, `#embeddings`,
and `#knowledge` redirect here.

**Settings** — Form-driven configuration editor for identity, embedding,
memory, pipeline, connector, and review settings. Changes are saved to the
resolved config files under `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/`.

**Memory search** — Browse and search your memory database from the ontology
workspace. Search runs hybrid (semantic + keyword) lookup. You can filter by
type, tags, source harness, pinned status, importance score, and date. Each
memory card has a "Find Similar" action that runs vector similarity search.
The count shown reflects your current filter state.

**Embeddings / Constellation** — A 3D force-directed graph of your memory space
(powered by `3d-force-graph` / Three.js). Memories with vector
embeddings appear as nodes; edges connect k-nearest neighbors.

Coordinates are computed server-side via UMAP dimensionality reduction
(`GET /api/embeddings/projection`) and cached until the embedding count
changes. The server returns both 2D and 3D projections; the dashboard
uses the 3D variant. Node positions are scaled by a factor of 52 and
seeded from the UMAP coordinates; the force simulation refines layout
from there.

Nodes are colored by source (the `who` field). Node size scales with
importance (base 0.6, up to 2.0). Click a node to inspect the memory
and view its nearest neighbors in a side panel. Hovering a node shows
a tooltip with the source and a truncated content label.

Filter presets let you slice the graph by source, memory type, or
importance range. Preset selections are persisted to `localStorage`.

**Cluster lens mode** highlights a selected node's neighborhood:
when active, only nodes in the `lensIds` set are rendered at full
opacity while the rest are dimmed. Edges are similarly filtered.
Pinned memories are visually distinguished.

The `EmbeddingCanvas3D` component exposes `focusNode(id)` to animate
the camera toward a specific node, and `refreshAppearance()` to
re-apply color/opacity changes without rebuilding the graph.

**Constellation View — Entity Overlay**

The Embeddings tab's constellation view renders a 4-tier D3 force
simulation that layers the knowledge graph on top of the memory space:

- **Entities** (hexagons, 10–22px) — gravitational centers, sized by
  mention density
- **Aspects** (circles, 5–8px) — orbit their parent entity
- **Attributes** (small circles, 3–4px) — orbit their parent aspect
- **Memories** (dots, 2px) — leaf nodes, orbit their parent attribute

Performance caps keep the simulation responsive:
- Zero-mention entities are excluded unless pinned by the user
- Maximum 500 entities, ordered by pinned status then mention count
- Memory leaf nodes are dropped entirely if total node count exceeds 3,000

Clicking an entity node opens an inspector panel showing the entity type,
aspects list, dependency edges, and memory count. Clicking a memory node
opens the existing memory detail panel.

**Predictor Placeholders**

The dashboard does not currently ship a standalone Predictor tab. Legacy
`#predictor` hashes resolve to Settings, and the Knowledge view includes
placeholder predictor slices that stay empty until scorer comparison rows exist
in the daemon database.


**Pipeline — Active Sessions**

The Settings pipeline section includes active-session controls with per-session
bypass toggles. Each row shows the session key, harness name, runtime path, and
a Switch control to enable or disable bypass. Toggling the switch calls
`POST /api/sessions/:key/bypass` (see [Sessions and hooks API](./api/sessions-hooks.md#sessions)). When bypass
is on, all hooks for that session return empty no-op responses — MCP
tools still work normally.

The session list auto-refreshes every 30 seconds and is only visible
when at least one session is active.

**Audit** — Diagnostics and logs. The log view streams daemon events via Server-Sent Events
(`/api/logs/stream`). A Live/Stop toggle controls the stream.
Entries are color-coded by level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
and labeled by category: `daemon`, `api`, `memory`, `sync`, `git`,
`watcher`, `embedding`, `harness`, `system`, `hooks`, `pipeline`,
`skills`, `secrets`, `auth`, `session-tracker`, `summary-worker`,
`document-worker`, `maintenance`, `retention`, `llm`. Click an
entry to open a split detail panel with the full JSON payload,
duration display, and a copy-to-clipboard button.

**Secrets**: Shows stored secret names. Values are always masked. This
surface is owned by the `signet.secrets` core plugin, backed by the local
encrypted provider and 1Password compatibility flow. You can add new
secrets (via a password input) or delete existing ones. For CLI use,
prefer `signet secret put <NAME>`.

**Skills** — Lists installed skills and marketplace catalog entries from
Signet, skills.sh, and ClawHub sources. Click a skill name to read details
before installing. Already-installed skills are marked.

The Skills tab also includes **Plugins**, a registry view for core and
installed Signet extensions. It shows plugin state, health, capability
grants, declared surfaces, prompt contribution diagnostics, and recent
plugin audit events. Core plugins such as `signet.secrets` can be
enabled or disabled there; disabling Signet Secrets blocks secret-owned
surfaces but does not delete encrypted secrets from disk.


API-Only Fallback
-----------------

If the dashboard build is missing (e.g., running the daemon from source
without building the frontend), visiting `http://localhost:3850` shows
a minimal HTML page listing available API endpoints instead.

Build the dashboard to restore the full UI:

```bash
cd surfaces/dashboard
bun run build
```


Development
-----------

To run the dashboard in dev mode with hot reload:

```bash
cd surfaces/dashboard
bun install
bun run dev
```

This starts a Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173`. The daemon
must still be running at port 3850 for API calls to work.


Tasks Tab
---------

The Tasks tab shows a kanban board for scheduled agent prompts. Four
columns display task state:

- **Scheduled** — Enabled tasks waiting for their next run
- **Running** — Currently executing tasks with elapsed timer
- **Completed** — Recent successful runs
- **Failed** — Recent failed runs with error summary

Each card shows the task name, harness badge, cron schedule, and
next/last run time. Click a card to open the detail sheet with full
run history and stdout/stderr logs.

Use the **+ New Task** button to create tasks. The form includes
cron presets, harness selection, and a security warning for Claude
Code's `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag.

Tasks can be enabled/disabled via the toggle switch on each card,
or triggered for an immediate manual run.


Port Configuration
------------------

The default port is 3850. To change it:

```bash
SIGNET_PORT=4000 signet daemon start
```

The dashboard URL changes accordingly.


Development Conventions
-----------------------

These conventions apply to all dashboard UI work.

### Stack

- **Framework**: Svelte 5 (runes: `$props`, `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, no `tailwind.config`)
- **UI primitives**: shadcn-svelte (https://www.shadcn-svelte.com)
- **Icons**: Lucide (`@lucide/svelte/icons/<name>`)
- **Visualization**: 3d-force-graph, D3, CodeMirror 6
- **Build**: Vite + SvelteKit static adapter

### Component Organization

```
surfaces/dashboard/src/lib/
  components/
    ui/           # shadcn-svelte primitives (button, card, tabs, etc.)
    memory/       # Memory feature components
    embeddings/   # Constellation / canvas views
    config/       # Config editor components (FormField, FormSection)
    sessions/     # Session management and bypass toggle
    skills/       # Skills marketplace components
    tasks/        # Task scheduler components
    app-sidebar.svelte   # Main navigation sidebar
    CodeEditor.svelte    # CodeMirror wrapper
    ToastContainer.svelte
  stores/         # Svelte 5 rune stores (*.svelte.ts)
  api.ts          # Daemon API client
```

- Always use existing shadcn-svelte components from
  `$lib/components/ui/` when possible. Do not recreate primitives.
- Feature components go in their domain subdirectory (e.g. `memory/`,
  `skills/`, `tasks/`).
- Component naming: PascalCase for feature components (`SkillCard.svelte`),
  kebab-case for shadcn primitives (`button.svelte`).
- Props use Svelte 5 `$props()` with explicit TypeScript interfaces.
- Import shadcn components via barrel: `$lib/components/ui/card/index.js`

### Design Tokens

Tokens are CSS custom properties defined in
`surfaces/dashboard/src/app.css`. Dark theme is the default;
light activates via `data-theme="light"` on `<html>`.

**Never hardcode hex colors.** Always use token variables:

| Purpose | Token |
|---------|-------|
| Page background | `var(--sig-bg)` / `bg-background` |
| Card surface | `var(--sig-surface)` / `bg-card` |
| Raised surface | `var(--sig-surface-raised)` / `bg-secondary` |
| Primary text | `var(--sig-text)` / `text-foreground` |
| Bright text | `var(--sig-text-bright)` / `text-primary` |
| Muted text | `var(--sig-text-muted)` / `text-muted-foreground` |
| Border | `var(--sig-border)` / `border-border` |
| Strong border | `var(--sig-border-strong)` / `border-input` |
| Accent | `var(--sig-accent)` |
| Danger | `var(--sig-danger)` / `bg-destructive` |
| Success | `var(--sig-success)` |

**Spacing scale**: `--space-xs` (4px), `--space-sm` (8px),
`--space-md` (16px), `--space-lg` (24px), `--space-xl` (48px),
`--space-2xl` (80px).

**Typography**: Display font `var(--font-display)` (Diamond Grotesk /
Chakra Petch) for headings. Monospace `var(--font-mono)` (Geist Mono /
IBM Plex Mono) for body text and UI. Base font size is 13px.

**Font sizes**: `--font-size-xs` (10px), `--font-size-sm` (11px),
`--font-size-base` (13px), `--font-size-lg` (15px).

**Utility classes**: `sig-label` (11px muted), `sig-eyebrow` (10px
uppercase), `sig-heading` (11px bold uppercase), `sig-meta` (9px),
`sig-badge` (9px rounded), `sig-micro` (8px uppercase).

### Styling Rules

- Use Tailwind utility classes mapped through the `@theme inline`
  block in `app.css` (e.g. `bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`,
  `border-border`).
- For Signet-specific tokens not in the Tailwind theme, use
  `style="color: var(--sig-accent)"` or arbitrary values
  `text-[var(--sig-accent)]`.
- Transitions use `var(--dur)` (0.2s) and `var(--ease)`
  (cubic-bezier). The grain overlay and scrollbar styles are global.
- Headings are uppercase with letter-spacing. Use `sig-heading` class
  or match the pattern: `font-display font-bold uppercase tracking-wider`.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — the global CSS disables
  animations when active.

### Icon System

- All icons come from `@lucide/svelte/icons/<icon-name>`.
  Import individually, not from the barrel.
  ```svelte
  import Brain from "@lucide/svelte/icons/brain";
  ```
- Do not import or add new icon packages. If a design requires an
  icon not in Lucide, flag it.
- Icon color backgrounds use `--sig-icon-bg-1` through `--sig-icon-bg-6`
  with `--sig-icon-fg` foreground and `--sig-icon-border` stroke.

### State Management

- Stores are Svelte 5 rune-based files at `$lib/stores/*.svelte.ts`.
- Navigation uses `$lib/stores/navigation.svelte.ts` (hash-based tabs).
- API calls go through `$lib/api.ts` which talks to the daemon at
  `localhost:3850`.
- Use `$state()`, `$derived()`, `$effect()` — not legacy stores.

### Svelte 5 Conventions

- Use `$props()` with destructured interface, not `export let`.
- Use `{@render children()}` for slot content, not `<slot>`.
- Event handlers: `onclick`, `onkeydown` (lowercase), not `on:click`.
- Use `$effect()` for side effects, not `afterUpdate`.
- Wrap mutable external references in `$state.raw()` or
  `untrack()` where needed to prevent infinite reactivity loops.
