Signet Daemon
=============

The Signet daemon is a background service that provides the [[api|HTTP API]],
serves the [[dashboard]], watches config files for changes, manages
[[harnesses|harness]] synchronization, and exposes an [[mcp|MCP server]] for
native tool access. It also runs the [[pipeline|memory pipeline]] and a
suite of subsystem workers for ingestion, retention, maintenance,
[[analytics]], and [[diagnostics]].

The daemon runs on `http://localhost:3850` by default.


Starting and Stopping
---------------------

### Via CLI

```bash
signet daemon start    # Start the daemon
signet daemon stop     # Stop the daemon
signet daemon restart  # Restart the daemon
signet status          # Check status
```

Top-level aliases `signet start`, `signet stop`, and `signet restart`
still exist, but `signet daemon ...` is the preferred command surface.

### Via System Service

The daemon can be installed as a system service for auto-start on boot.

**macOS (launchd):**
```bash
cd platform/daemon
bun run install:service

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.signet.daemon.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.signet.daemon.plist
```

**Linux (systemd):**
```bash
cd platform/daemon
bun run install:service

systemctl --user start signet.service
systemctl --user stop signet.service
systemctl --user status signet.service
systemctl --user enable signet.service   # enable on boot
```


Configuration
-------------

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SIGNET_PORT` | `3850` | HTTP server port |
| `SIGNET_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Daemon host used for local calls |
| `SIGNET_BIND` | network mode bind | Explicit bind address override; defaults to `127.0.0.1` in localhost mode and `0.0.0.0` in tailscale mode |
| `SIGNET_PATH` | `~/.agents` | Runtime override for the agents directory |
| `SIGNET_LOG_FILE` | — | Optional explicit log file path |
| `SIGNET_LOG_DIR` | `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs` | Optional log directory override |
| `SIGNET_SQLITE_PATH` | — | macOS explicit SQLite dylib override used before Bun opens the database |

### Files

When log path overrides are set:
- `SIGNET_LOG_FILE` takes highest precedence and points to the exact file.
- Else `SIGNET_LOG_DIR` overrides the default log directory.
- Else the default `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs/` paths below apply.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/pid` | Process ID file |
| `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs/` | Log directory |
| `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs/signet-YYYY-MM-DD.log` | Daily log file |
| `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs/daemon.out.log` | stdout capture |
| `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs/daemon.err.log` | stderr capture |


Subsystems
----------

The daemon starts several concurrent workers when it initializes. Each
worker runs its own loop and stops cleanly when the daemon shuts down.

### Pipeline Workers

The pipeline lives at `platform/daemon/src/pipeline/` and is managed
by `startPipeline()` / `stopPipeline()`. Four workers run in parallel:

**Extraction worker** (`worker.ts`) polls the `memory_jobs` queue for
pending extraction jobs. Each job runs the conversation through the
configured extraction provider (default `llama-cpp` with model
`qwen3.5:4b`), then passes the result to the decision stage which
decides whether to write, update, or skip. The provider and decision
stages run outside write locks to keep contention low.

**Document worker** (`document-worker.ts`) polls `memory_jobs` for
`document_ingest` jobs. It fetches remote URLs if needed, chunks the
content hierarchically, embeds each chunk, and links chunks to their
source document via `document_memories`. The same transaction
discipline applies: no provider calls inside write locks.

**Retention worker** (`retention-worker.ts`) runs on a periodic timer
and purges memories that have decayed below their retention threshold.
It can also be triggered manually by the maintenance worker.

**Maintenance worker** (`maintenance-worker.ts`) runs diagnostics on
a configurable interval and, depending on `maintenanceMode`, either
logs recommendations (`observe`) or executes repair actions
(`execute`). It tracks consecutive ineffective repairs and halts a
given repair action after three failed attempts to avoid thrashing.
Requires `autonomousEnabled: true` and `autonomousFrozen: false` in
pipeline config to activate the timed loop; otherwise it is passive
and can be triggered via the API.

Pipeline config modes:

| Mode flag | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `shadowMode` | Extract memories but do not write them |
| `mutationsFrozen` | Read-only; no writes at all |
| `graph.enabled` | Enable knowledge graph traversal on recall |
| `autonomous.enabled` | Allow the maintenance worker to run repairs |
| `autonomous.frozen` | Pause autonomous repairs without disabling |
| `autonomous.maintenanceMode` | `"observe"` (log only) or `"execute"` (act) |

### Session Tracker

The session tracker (`session-tracker.ts`) enforces a mutex on the
runtime path per session. Connectors send an `x-signet-runtime-path`
header with each hook request — either `"plugin"` or `"legacy"`. Once
a session is claimed by one path, any request arriving from the other
path receives a `409 Conflict`. Stale sessions expire after 4 hours
and are cleaned up every 15 minutes.

### Auth Middleware

The daemon supports three deployment modes: `local` (default, no
authentication required), `team` (all requests require a bearer
token), and `hybrid` (localhost requests bypass auth, remote requests
require a token). Token roles are `admin`, `operator`, `agent`, and
`readonly`, each with a different permission set. Rate limiting is
applied per token. See [docs/AUTH.md](./AUTH.md) for full details on
configuration, token creation, and permission scopes.

### Analytics

The analytics collector (`analytics.ts`) accumulates ephemeral
in-memory counters for the lifetime of the daemon process. Nothing
is persisted to disk — the structured logs and `memory_history` table
provide durable backing. The collector tracks:

- **Usage counters** — per-endpoint call counts, error counts, and
  total latency; per-actor request/remember/recall/mutation counts;
  per-provider call counts and latency; per-connector sync counts.
- **Error ring buffer** — a fixed-size circular buffer of recent
  errors keyed by stage (`extraction`, `decision`, `embedding`,
  `mutation`, `connector`).
- **Latency histograms** — bucketed latency distributions per stage,
  useful for spotting tail latency without external tooling.

All counters reset on daemon restart. See [docs/ANALYTICS.md](./ANALYTICS.md)
for the API endpoints and data shapes.

### Timeline

The timeline builder (`timeline.ts`) reconstructs a chronological
incident trace for a given entity ID — a memory ID, request ID, or
session ID. It joins across `memory_history`, `memory_jobs`, the
in-process log buffer, and the error ring buffer to produce an ordered
list of events. This is primarily a debugging tool for tracing what
happened to a specific memory across extraction, decision, embedding,
and mutation phases. See [docs/ANALYTICS.md](./ANALYTICS.md) for
details on the timeline endpoint.

### Diagnostics

The diagnostics module (`diagnostics.ts`) evaluates six health
domains and returns a composite score:

| Domain | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| `queue` | Job queue depth, dead job rate, stale leases |
| `storage` | Total memories, tombstone ratio, database size |
| `index` | FTS row count vs active memories, embedding coverage |
| `provider` | Ollama availability rate, recent timeouts and failures |
| `mutation` | Recent recover and delete event rates |
| `connector` | Active connector count, sync errors, error age |

Each domain produces a `score` (0–1) and a `status` of `healthy`,
`degraded`, or `unhealthy`. The composite score is a weighted average
across all six. The maintenance worker uses this report to decide
which repair actions to invoke. See [docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md](./DIAGNOSTICS.md)
for the full report schema and repair action catalog.


HTTP API
--------

The daemon exposes endpoints across these domains: memory, skills,
secrets, hooks, harnesses, auth, documents, connectors, diagnostics,
pipeline, repair, analytics, telemetry, timeline, git sync, update,
tasks, and logs. The table below lists the major groups. See
[docs/API.md](./API.md) for the full reference including
request/response schemas.

```


File Watcher
------------

The daemon watches these paths with chokidar:

- `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/agent.yaml`
- `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/AGENTS.md`
- `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/SOUL.md`
- `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/MEMORY.md`
- `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/IDENTITY.md`
- `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/USER.md`
- `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/memory/` (entire directory)
- `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` (Claude Code project memories)

### Auto-Ingestion

When memory markdown files are created or modified, the daemon
automatically ingests them using hierarchical chunking to preserve
section structure. Each chunk includes its section header for context.
A SHA-256 hash prevents re-processing unchanged files. Ingestion runs
on startup and on file change.

| File pattern | Who | Tags |
|--------------|-----|------|
| `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/memory/*.md` (not MEMORY.md) | `openclaw-memory` | `openclaw`, `memory-log`, date |
| `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` | `claude-code` | `claude-code`, `claude-project-memory`, project ID |

### Auto Git Commit

When a watched file changes, the daemon waits 5 seconds (debounce),
checks whether `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/` is a git repository, stages all changes
with `git add -A`, and commits with a message in the form
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS_auto_<filename>`.

### Harness Sync

When `AGENTS.md` changes, the daemon waits 2 seconds, then
regenerates harness configuration files. It writes to:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (if `~/.claude/` exists)
- `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (if `~/.config/opencode/` exists)

Each generated file includes a header noting the source path and
timestamp.


Security
--------

### Network Binding

The daemon binds to loopback by default and is not reachable from
other machines. Set `network.mode: tailscale` or `SIGNET_BIND` to expose it
on a broader interface, but pair that with auth mode `team` or `hybrid`.

### Auth Modes

In `local` mode (the default), no credentials are required. This is
fine for single-user local use. For any networked or shared
deployment, switch to `team` or `hybrid` mode. See
[docs/AUTH.md](./AUTH.md) for setup instructions.

### File Permissions

The daemon reads and writes only files accessible to the running user.
It does not escalate privileges.


Logging
-------

Logs are written to the console and to a daily file at
`$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/logs/signet-YYYY-MM-DD.log` by default. When
`SIGNET_LOG_FILE` is set, logs are written to that exact file.
When `SIGNET_LOG_DIR` is set (and `SIGNET_LOG_FILE` is unset), daily
logs are written under `$SIGNET_LOG_DIR/`.

```
[2025-02-17T18:00:00.000Z] [INFO] Message here
[2025-02-17T18:00:01.000Z] [WARN] Warning message
[2025-02-17T18:00:02.000Z] [ERROR] Error message
```

Log levels: `INFO` for normal operations, `WARN` for non-fatal issues,
`ERROR` for errors that do not crash the daemon.


Troubleshooting
---------------

### Daemon won't start

Check whether port 3850 is already in use:
```bash
lsof -i :3850
```

Remove a stale PID file if present:
```bash
rm $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.daemon/pid
signet daemon start
```

Read the error log:
```bash
cat "${SIGNET_LOG_FILE:-$HOME/.agents/.daemon/logs/daemon.err.log}"
```

### Daemon keeps crashing

Check for syntax errors in config:
```bash
cat $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/agent.yaml
```

Verify database integrity:
```bash
sqlite3 $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/memory/memories.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

### Dashboard not loading

Confirm the daemon is running and the dashboard was built:
```bash
signet status
curl http://localhost:3850/health
ls surfaces/dashboard/build/
```

### File changes not syncing

Check the watcher logs, confirm the git repository exists, and verify
file permissions:
```bash
ls $SIGNET_WORKSPACE/.git
```

### Pipeline jobs stuck

Check diagnostics for queue health and dead job rates:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3850/api/diagnostics
```

If the dead job rate is high, trigger a repair manually:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3850/api/repair/requeue-dead-jobs
```
