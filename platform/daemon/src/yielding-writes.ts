/**
 * Bounded write-batch drain with cooperative event-loop yielding.
 *
 * **Why this exists (#1059).** SQLite's synchronous API (`bun:sqlite`) blocks
 * the JavaScript event loop for the duration of each call. A background loop
 * that runs thousands of writes inside one {@link DbAccessor.withWriteTx}
 * freezes the entire thread — no HTTP handler (including `/health`) can
 * execute — until the watchdog SIGKILLs the process. The death spiral:
 * background work blocks → /health starves → kill → crash recovery resets
 * in-flight jobs → restart → same backlog → repeat.
 *
 * **The fix.** Background write loops use this primitive instead of raw
 * `withWriteTx`. Each batch runs in its own short transaction (bounded by
 * `maxPerTx`), and between batches the primitive yields a macrotask so the
 * event loop can service HTTP. It also checks {@link isSystemPressureHigh}
 * and pauses when the event loop is degraded — active backpressure, not just
 * passive yielding.
 *
 * Each batch's transaction is short enough (tens of milliseconds for typical
 * batch sizes) that the event loop is never blocked long enough to trip the
 * health watchdog. The guarantee is structural: any loop using this primitive
 * cannot monopolize the thread, regardless of total work volume.
