Models change. Providers change. Agent shells change. Your context should not.

Your agents are starting to remember projects, users, decisions, documents,
conversations, preferences, mistakes, routines, and private working context.

That memory is no longer a feature. It is infrastructure — and custody matters.

Signet is a local-first context layer for AI agents: memory, identity,
transcripts, source records, provenance, agent instructions, secrets, and
repair tools in infrastructure you control.

Hosted memory APIs are fastest until memory becomes part of your product
contract: deletion, provenance, repair, portability, and private context
custody. Signet is for that moment.

Not another hosted memory API. Not another harness-specific plugin. Signet is
the durable layer underneath your agents.

## Why Signet

| Claim | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Local-first custody | SQLite, readable workspace files, transcripts, source records, memories, and identity files live where you control them |
| Source-backed recall | Every useful memory can point back to where it came from |
| Repairable memory | Inspect, edit, supersede, delete, reclassify, and scope bad context |
| Portable across agents | One layer works across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI, Hermes Agent, MCP, SDKs, and apps |
| Team deployment primitives | Signet includes scoped agents, visibility, auth policy, retention controls, secrets storage, and audit-friendly APIs |
| Proven recall | LongMemEval-tracked recall without giving up governance |

You know you need Signet when agent memory is no longer just recall quality.
You need to know where context lives, where it came from, who can see it, how
it can be corrected, what gets deleted, and whether it can move when your
tools change.

## Quick start (about 5 minutes)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash
signet setup               # interactive setup wizard
signet status              # confirm daemon + pipeline health
signet dashboard           # open memory + retrieval inspector
```

If you already use Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Codex, Gemini CLI,
Pi, Oh My Pi, or Hermes Agent, keep your existing harness. Signet installs
under it.

## Proof in one repair loop

Run this once:

```bash
signet remember "Project Atlas deploys only after QA signs off" \
  --tags project-atlas --who user
signet recall "Project Atlas deploy policy" --tags project-atlas --json
```

Then open the dashboard:

```bash
signet dashboard
```

This is the smallest proof, but it shows the product shape: the memory is
local, queryable, tagged, visible in the dashboard, and repairable instead of
being trapped behind a hosted recall response.

If recall returns a stale deployment policy, you can edit or delete the memory,
run the same recall again, and verify the agent is seeing corrected context
before it acts.

In the dashboard, the record is not a black-box snippet:

```text
Memory: Project Atlas deploys only after QA signs off
Tags: project-atlas
Dashboard actions: edit · delete · mark pinned · similar
Daemon lifecycle: modify · forget · recover
```

## How Signet is different

| Alternative | Good for | Where Signet is different |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted memory APIs | Fast prototypes and managed memory | Signet keeps storage, provenance, ranking policy, repair, deletion, and self-hosting under your control |
| Harness-specific plugins | Improving memory inside one agent shell | Signet runs underneath many harnesses, so context survives tool churn |
| Vector/RAG memory | Searching notes and documents | Signet keeps transcripts, identity, source records, repair history, and scoped recall |
| Lightweight local stores | Simple private persistence | Signet adds provenance, dashboard inspection, team policy, connectors, MCP, SDKs, and daemon APIs |

Hosted memory APIs are great for prototypes. They get uncomfortable when
memory becomes part of your product contract: storage, recall policy,
deletion, provenance, and portability all matter.

| Stay hosted if... | Switch to Signet when... |
|---|---|
| You need the fastest managed API path | Memory has to live in infrastructure you control |
| Recall quality is the only contract | Deletion, repair, provenance, and auditability are also part of the contract |
| One app owns the memory surface | Multiple agents, harnesses, SDKs, MCP clients, or internal apps need the same context |
| Vendor-managed ranking is acceptable | You need to inspect and tune recall policy around your own sources |
| You cannot run a daemon or own backups yet | You need an exportable workspace you can inspect, back up, and move |

## Switching cost

Signet is infrastructure, so it has a real operating surface:
- a local or self-hosted daemon
- an embedding provider
- a SQLite-backed workspace to back up
- harness connectors, hooks, MCP servers, or SDK calls depending on your stack

The trade is deliberate: you operate the memory layer, and in return you can
inspect, repair, scope, self-host, and move the context your agents depend on.

Day two is bounded: keep the daemon healthy, back up `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/`,
rerun setup when harness integrations change, and use local/team/hybrid auth
mode based on how the daemon is exposed. The upside is that failures remain
inspectable because the data plane is still yours.

For a single-developer install, day two usually means `signet status`, backing
up one workspace directory, and rerunning setup only when you add or replace an
agent harness.

## Is Signet right for you?

Use Signet if you want:
- agents that remember across sessions without prompt bootstrapping
- memory your team can inspect, repair, scope, and self-host
- source-backed recall across private docs, repos, conversations, and artifacts
- one memory layer across agent harnesses, MCP clients, SDKs, and custom apps

Signet may be overkill if you only need short-lived chat memory inside a
single hosted assistant or a simple vector search endpoint.

## Harness support

Signet is not trying to win by being another agent shell. It runs underneath
the tools people already use and gives them one owned memory layer.

| Harness | Integration path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Hooks + MCP | Direct `/remember` and `/recall` skills |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) | Plugin + hooks | Runtime plugin with lifecycle support |
| [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | Runtime plugin | Flagship path; legacy hooks remain compatibility-only |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | MCP + compatibility hooks | Plugin bundle when available; degraded compaction fidelity |
| [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) | Memory provider plugin | `memory_*`, `recall`, and `remember` tools |
| [Pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) | Extension + hooks | Memory commands and agent-callable tools |
| Oh My Pi | Managed extension | Lifecycle recall injection; no `/remember` or `/recall` commands yet |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | MCP + GEMINI.md sync | On-demand tools plus identity sync |

## Memory that holds up

Signet's latest tracked MemoryBench run averages **97.6% LongMemEval answer
accuracy** under the `rules` profile.

The benchmark matters because Signet is not only governable memory. It also
retrieves the right facts across long-running, multi-session conversations.

That profile keeps the benchmark contract strict: memories are ingested through
`/api/memory/remember`, recalled through `/api/memory/recall`, and answered
from bounded daemon recall results. Search does not call an LLM.

See [Benchmarks](./docs/BENCHMARKING.md#current-longmemeval-score) for the
methodology, scoring note, and run workflow.

## Install (detailed)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://signetai.sh/install.sh | bash
npm install -g signetai
bun add -g signetai
signet setup               # interactive setup wizard
```

curl, npm, and Bun all install the same compiled Signet binary. The npm and
Bun package-manager paths use optional native packages for the current platform;
install scripts only link the already-installed binary into place. They do not
install Bun, rebuild Signet, or install daemon dependencies.
Published native binaries currently cover Linux x64, Linux arm64, macOS x64,
macOS arm64, and Windows x64. Windows direct installs should use
`npm install -g signetai`; the old PowerShell `install.ps1` path has been
removed until a native Windows direct installer ships.

The wizard initializes `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE/`, configures your harnesses, sets up
an embedding provider, creates the database, and starts the daemon.

> Path note: `$SIGNET_WORKSPACE` means your active Signet workspace path.
> Default is `~/.agents`, configurable via `signet workspace set <path>`.

### Tell your agent to install it

Paste this to your AI agent:

```
Install and fully configure Signet AI by following this guide exactly: https://signetai.sh/skill.md
```

### CLI use

```bash
signet status              # check daemon health
signet dashboard           # open the web UI

signet remember "prefers bun over npm"
signet recall "coding preferences"
```

### Multi-agent

Multiple named agents share one daemon and database. Each agent gets its
own identity directory (`~/.agents/agents/<name>/`) and configurable
memory visibility:

```bash
signet agent add alice --memory isolated   # alice sees only her own memories
signet agent add bob --memory shared       # bob sees all global memories
signet agent add ci --memory group --group eng  # ci sees memories from the eng group

signet agent list                          # roster + policies
signet remember "deploy window is Fridays" --agent alice --private
signet recall "deploy window" --agent alice  # scoped to alice's visible memories
signet agent info alice                    # identity files, policy, memory count
```

Use the secrets subsystem for credentials. Do not store tokens or keys as
recallable memories.

OpenClaw users get zero-config routing — session keys like
`agent:alice:discord:direct:u123` are parsed automatically; no
`agentId` header needed.

In harnesses with command-style integrations, skills work directly:

```text
/remember critical: never commit secrets to git
/recall release process
```

## How it works

Signet separates memory into three layers:

```text
workspace / transcripts
  truth layer: raw files, identity docs, source records, session history

semantic memory
  navigation layer: summaries, entities, decisions, constraints, relations

query layer
  retrieval lens: FTS, vector search, graph traversal, scopes, provenance
```

The record is preserved first. The daemon indexes it, extracts useful
structure, and keeps recall bounded and inspectable. The agent gets the
right context before the next prompt starts, with a path back to the raw
source when the semantic layer is not enough.

After setup, there is no per-session memory ceremony. The pipeline runs
in the background and the agent wakes up with its memory intact.
